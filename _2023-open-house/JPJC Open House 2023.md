<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>

<ol>
	<li><h5>What are some programmes JPJC offer to promote holistic development?</h5>

<p>
JPJC offers varied programmes to develop our students holistically. Programmes offered under our the Talent and Leadership Development Programme include CCAs, Student Interest Groups, enrichment, competitions in various areas of interests. Our Scholars Development Programme also provides opportunities for high potential students to develop their leadership potential, widen their network and make meaningful contributions to the community.</p>

<p>
Please access the following web links for more information provided of our programmes:</p>

<a href="/jpjc-experience/co-curriculum/talent-and-leadership/">Talent & Leadership Development</a><br>
<a href="/jpjc-experience/co-curriculum/talent-and-leadership-development-programme/scholars-development/">Scholars Development Programme</a></li><br>
	<li><h5>What is the 2023 cut-off point for JPJC?</h5>

<p>
For reference, the 2022 L1R5 cut-off point for the Science Stream is 14 and the Arts Stream is 16. The 2023 cut-off point for JPJC will only be made available after JAE 2023.</p></li><br>
	<li><h5>My preferred subject combination is not listed on the college website. Will I be able to choose my preferred subject combination?</h5>

<p>
JPJC provides a wide range of subject combinations to cater to students’ personal interests, abilities and future career choices. Take a look <a href="/about/subject-combination/">here</a> and find one that best suits your needs and aspirations.</p></li><br>
	<li><h5>How do I appeal for admission to the college?</h5>
		
<p>
Students who would like to appeal should complete an online application which will be made available on the school’s website. The college will contact shortlisted applicants for an interview. We seek your understanding that the college will not be accepting walk-in appeals as of now.</p></li><br>
	<li><h5>What is the selection process like for Student Council? How many days do we need to commit for student council if we were to take it?</h5>
		
<p>
The selection process involves two stages: (a) the preliminary interview, followed by (b) the student polls. Shortlisted students from the preliminary interview will be placed into campaigning groups, who will then engage the student population through various means in order to get their support/vote. After a week, the JC1 cohort will then cast their votes and the number of votes received will be considered with other factors before a student is formally accepted into the Student Council.</p>

<p>
The Student Council conducts CCA sessions twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays. As the CCA sees to large-scale projects or programmes such as the OGL Camp, Matriculation and Orientation programme, Teachers’ Day celebration and Graduation Night, Student Councilors may be called back on additional days for small-scale testing, rehearsals or other preparatory work etc. in preparation for these events.</p>
		
<p>
On top of that, Student Councilors will be involved in leadership workshop or camps, together with other CCA leaders, organised by the College.</p></li><br>
	<li><h5>Could the school elaborate on the house system? E.g. How are students allocated?</h5>
		
<p>
For information on the House System please access this <a href="/jpjc-experience/co-curriculum/talent-n-leadership-development-programme/house-system/">link</a>.</p>

<p>
Generally students are allocated a House based on the class that they are in. Students who are interested in fostering the school spirit through their House can either become a House Executive of their class or through joining the Student Council.</p></li><br>
	<li><h5>How many days are CCA Days and what are the timings?</h5>
		
<p>
In general, the college CCA days are designated on Wednesdays (3pm - 6pm) and Fridays (4pm to 7pm). Depending on the nature of the CCA and activities, the duration of the CCA activities will last between 2 - 3 hours per session.</p></li><br>
