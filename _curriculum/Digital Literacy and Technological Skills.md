<p>At JPJC, the <b>Digital Literacy and Technological Skills (DLTS) curriculum</b> is extensive, designed to prepare students for lifelong learning and success in an increasingly digital world.</p>

<p>The curriculum includes both <b>compulsory</b> and <b>elective</b> components. From 2026, all JC1 students will undergo a <b>baseline digital literacy program</b> focusing on the <b>effective use of AI for learning</b>. Beyond this, students can further develop other digital competencies across the curriculum and co-curricular activities.

</p><p>The curriculum supports growth in three key areas of digital competencies:
	</p><ul><li><b>Hard (Digital) Competencies</b>: Technical and functional skills, including the use of specific software and tools, as well as systematic problem-solving methods in digital environments.</li>
		<li><b>Soft (Digital) Competencies</b>: Mindsets, dispositions, and behaviours related to the ethical use of digital technology, along with critical thinking skills for evaluating digital content and interactions.</li>
		<li><b>Blended (Digital) Competencies</b>: Competencies that integrate both hard (technical) and soft (behavioural) digital skills to achieve meaningful learning outcomes.</li>

<p>The above highlights the software and tools that students can learn or pick up as part of their <b>hard (digital) competencies</b> development. Students also acquire <b>soft</b> and <b>blended digital competencies</b>, tailoring their learning to their interests and aspirations across the curriculum and co-curriculum.</p>
