### **Chinese Language Elective Programme**
Jurong Pioneer Junior College is a Ministry of Education (MOE) Language Elective Programme (LEP) Centre for Chinese.

Students who are enrolled in the Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) must take Chinese Language and Literature at H2 level. Interested students may also take another CL related subject such as H2 China Studies in Chinese or H2 Translation.

**Overseas Immersion Trip**

Each year, MOE CPDD organises a 15-day CLEP Overseas Immersion Trip to Beijing/ Shanghai and Taipei. Not only do JPJC CLEP students acquire a deeper understanding of Chinese literature, language and culture, they also get to interact with stude nts from the four other CLEP centres, namely Hwa Chong Institution (College), Temasek Junior College, Nanyang Juni or College and Dunman High S chool, and forge great friendships.

CLEP students will have exposure to a wide variety of weekly college-based activities conducted exclusively for them, such as song writing, tea art appreciation, mini-lectures by distinguished experts and academics, calligraphy etc.

They also play an active role in the annual Chinese New Year Celebrations, Mother Tongue Fortnight Programmes as well as programmes under the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme.
