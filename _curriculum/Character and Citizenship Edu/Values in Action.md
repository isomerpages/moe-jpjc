<p>The Service Learning (SL) programme aims to inculcate a sense of social and civic responsibility in students by encouraging them to learn through serving the college and community. With the mission of nurturing a community of compassionate leaders with a heart to serve, the college adopts a whole-school approach to SL, where all students are encouraged to participate in or lead Values-in-Action (VIA) projects through the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing students' awareness of community needs through discussions of community and social issues in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons and Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs).</li>

<li>Raising awareness of volunteerism through sharing sessions by community partners and providing opportunities for students to volunteer within the school and/or community in collaboration with these partners.</li>
	
<li>Empowering students to serve the community through CCA VIA, student-initiated VIA, and external VIA. Students take ownership of understanding the needs of beneficiaries and initiate Values-in-Action projects with their peers from their class or CCA.</li></ul>

<h4>Service Learning (SL) Festival</h4>

<p>The Service Learning (SL) Festival brings together students and representatives from social service agencies (SSAs) to explore a variety of opportunities, featuring booths and talks focused on volunteering prospects and career pathways in the social service sector. Students had the opportunity to interact with social service organisations, community partners, and alumni, gaining greater awareness of social causes and sourcing volunteering opportunities.</p>

<li>Raising Awareness and Green Advocacy<br>

Initiatives like "Recycling Right!" and the Green Bazaar encourage recycling, while events like the Sustainable Jurong Spring project inspire sustainable practices through interactive activities, workshops, and the promotion of reusing pre-loved items.</li>
