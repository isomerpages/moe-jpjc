<p>The Citizenship Education programme aims to develop students into culturally sensitive, socially responsible citizens with a global outlook and a strong sense of rootedness to Singapore. The programme seeks to cultivate citizenship dispositions in students, including a sense of belonging to the nation, hope in themselves and the future, as well as an awareness of the realities of Singapore's vulnerabilities and constraints. This understanding translates into a commitment to act on improving the lives of others and building a future for the nation. The programme employs the following approaches:</p>

<p></p><li>Engaging students in conversations during CCE and academic subject lessons allows them to share perspectives and discuss contemporary issues and public policies in a conducive environment.</li>

<p></p><li>Enriching Student Development Experiences (SDEs) through students' active participation in school-based activities, such as NE Commemorative Days, dialogue sessions with distinguished speakers, NS Engagement, Responders Plus Programme, and various festive celebrations.</li><p></p>

<li><b>Dialogue sessions with distinguished speaker</b><br>
In JC1, students participate in a dialogue session with a distinguished speaker from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where they hear the ambassador's perspectives and experiences and engage in discussions on contemporary realities of Singapore's foreign policy. In JC2, students participate in a dialogue session with a political office holder on policy matters, raising their awareness of national issues and the rationale behind government policies.</li>

<li><b>National Service (NS) Engagement</b><br>
The NS Engagement sessions aim to prepare students for National Service. For the boys, speakers from CMPB and MINDEF are invited to share insights on the pre-enlistment and vocation selection process, along with alumni who share their NS experiences with their juniors. For the girls, officers from the SAF Volunteer Corps and/or the Army Recruitment Centre are invited to share the various opportunities available for them to serve the nation.</li>

<li><b>Responders Plus Programme</b><br>
The college has partnered with the SCDF to enhance vigilance and emergency preparedness among the student population. SCDF officers conduct the Responders Plus Programme for student representatives from JC1 classes, equipping them with core life-saving skills such as basic first aid, CPR and AED usage, and firefighting techniques, while also raising their awareness of emergency procedures.</li>
