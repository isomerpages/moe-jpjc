Some of the distinctive elements of the JPJC CLEP are:</p>

<h4>Overseas Immersion Trip</h4>

<p>
Each year, MOE CPDD organises a 15-day CLEP Overseas Immersion Trip to Beijing/Shanghai and Taipei. Not only do JPJC CLEP students acquire a deeper understanding of Chinese literature, language and culture, they also get to interact with students from the four other CLEP centres, namely Hwa Chong Institution (College), Temasek Junior College, Nanyang Junior College and Dunman High School, and forge great friendships.</p>

<p>
CLEP students will have exposure to a wide variety of weekly college-based activities conducted exclusively for them, such as song writing, tea art appreciation, mini-lectures by distinguished experts and academics, calligraphy etc.</p>

<p>
They also play an active role in the annual Chinese New Year Celebrations, Mother Tongue Fortnight Programmes as well as programmes under the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme.</p>

<h4>“新空下” National Xinyao Singing and Song Writing Competition</h5>
	
<p>
Xinyao played an important part in the development of Singapore's cultural history. In the early 1980s, students got together and sang the songs which they have composed on their own, a first for the local music scene. Many of the pioneers of Xinyao, amongst which one of the most distinguished, Eric Moo, began their music journey in JJC in the early 1980s, before going on the bigger regional stage.  Chen Jia Ming, one of Singapore’s most prolific lyricists in the Mandopop scene, also started penning songs in JJC.</p>

<p>
In 2015, Jurong JC Mother Tongue Languages Department, together with TCR Music Station, organised the inaugural “新空下” National Xinyao Singing Competition. The competition received overwhelming responses from students of secondary schools and JC/CIs. In the spirit of injecting new life into the Xinyao legacy, a new song writing category has also been included in 2017 to encourage students to compose their own songs. In the same year, the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning came on board, and since then more new elements has been injected into the competition.</p>

<p>
Despite the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic since 2020, timely changes were made to the format of the competition. The seventh edition of  “新空下”  continued to make inroads in attracting students to showcase their talents in both singing Xinyao and composing new songs.</p>
