<p>	In 2006, then Jurong Junior College was selected by Ministry of Education (MOE) to be the fourth Language Elective Programme (LEP) centres for Chinese.  The CLEP was introduced by MOE in 1990, and it aims to:</p>
<li>Nurture promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Chinese.</li>
<li>Enhance their understanding of Chinese literature. </li>
<li>Develop students to be effectively bilingual to better serve the needs of our nation.</li>
<p>Students who are enrolled in the Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) must take Chinese Language and Literature at H2 level. Interested students may also take another CL-related subject such as H2 Translation.</p>

<p>
Some of the distinctive elements of the JPJC CLEP are:</p>

<h4>1. MOE Overseas Immersion Trip</h4>

<p>
Each year, MOE CPDD organises a 1.5-week CLEP Overseas Immersion Trip for the MOE Chinese Language Elective Scholars (CLES) to China.  Not only do our scholars acquire a deeper understanding of Chinese literature, language and culture, they also get to interact with students from the four other CLEP centres, namely Hwa Chong Institution (College), Temasek Junior College, Nanyang Junior College and Dunman High School, and forge deep friendships.</p>

<p>
CLEP students will have exposure to a wide variety of weekly college-based activities conducted exclusively for them, such as song writing, tea art appreciation, mini-lectures by distinguished experts and academics, calligraphy etc.</p>

<h4>2. MOE CLEP Camp</h4>

<p>One of the greatest highlights of the CLEP programme is the JC1 CLEP Camp organised by MOE for all the CLEP students in the five CLEP centres during the June holidays. This is usually a 3D/2N camp which is held at either NTU or NUS where all the CLEP students get to know one another as well as immerse in a learning journey of different literary genres/themes with academics, subject experts or local writers.</p>

<h4>6. “新空下” National Schools Xinyao Festival 2023</h4>
	
<p>
Xinyao 新谣 played an important part in the development of Singapore's cultural history. In the early 1980s, students got together and sang the songs which they have composed on their own, a first for the local music scene. Many of the pioneers of Xinyao, amongst which one of the most distinguished, Eric Moo, began their music journey in JJC in the early 1980s, before going on the bigger regional stage.  Chen Jia Ming, one of Singapore’s most prolific lyricists in the Mandopop scene, also started penning songs when he was a student in JJC.</p>

<p>
In 2015, the MTL dept of then Jurong JC, together with TCR Music Station and Lianhe Zaobao, organised the inaugural “新空下” National Xinyao Singing Competition. The competition received overwhelming responses from students from secondary schools and JC/CIs. In the spirit of injecting new life into the Xinyao legacy, a new song writing category has since been included in 2017 to encourage students to compose their own songs. In the same year, the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning came on board, and since then, more new elements has been injected to the event which has been rebranded as “新空下” National Schools Xinyao Festival in 2020. Through the COVID-19 pandemic, the format of the competition was adapted and continued to make inroads in attracting students to showcase their talents in both singing Xinyao and composing new songs.</p>
	
<p>
Each year, our CLEP students play an active role behind the scenes to contribute to the success of the event. Some also went on to be budding songwriters and in 2022 and 2023, two of the songs were awarded 1st runner-up, 2nd runner-up and one of the submissions, the Merit Award respectively.</p>
