<p>	In 2006, then Jurong Junior College was selected by Ministry of Education (MOE) to be the fourth Language Elective Programme (LEP) centres for Chinese.  The CLEP was introduced by MOE in 1990, and it aims to:</p>
<li>Nurture promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Chinese.</li>
<li>Enhance their understanding of Chinese literature. </li>
<li>Develop students to be effectively bilingual to better serve the needs of our nation.</li>
<p>Students who are enrolled in the Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) must take Chinese Language and Literature at H2 level. Interested students may also take another CL-related subject such as H2 Translation.</p>



<h4><b>1. MOE Overseas Immersion Trip</b></h4>

<p>
Each year, MOE CPDD organises a 9-day CLEP Overseas Immersion Trip for the MOE Chinese Language Elective Scholars (CLES) to China. As a CLEP Scholar, you’ll experience an enriching nine-day immersion trip to China, exploring Chinese literature, language, and culture up close. Highlights include visits to historic sites, lessons from professors at Peking University, and hands-on sessions that bring Chinese heritage to life.</p>
<p>It is also a great opportunity to connect with fellow scholars from the other four CLEP centres, forming friendships that make this experience unforgettable.</p>

<h4><b>2. MOE CLEP Camp</b></h4>

<p>A major highlight of the CLEP programme is the MOE CLEP Camp organised for all JC1 CLEP students from the five CLEP centres. Held during the first week of the June holidays, this 3D/2N or 3D non-residential camp at NTU or NUS offers an exciting opportunity to connect with fellow CLEP students, who are passionate to learn more about the Chinese language, literature and culture.</p>
<p>Participants engage in a rich learning journey, exploring various literary genres and themes with academics, subject experts, and local writers, while going on learning journeys to have a glimpse of various aspects of our society. This immersive experience strengthens both literary knowledge and friendships, making it an unforgettable part of the CLEP journey.

<h4><b>5. “新空下 Xin Kong Xia” National Schools Xinyao Festival</b></h4>
	
<p>
Xinyao (新谣) has played a significant role in shaping Singapore's cultural history. In the early 1980s, students began composing and singing their own songs, marking a pivotal moment in the local music scene. Many pioneers of Xinyao, including the distinguished Eric Moo, started their musical journeys at Jurong Junior College (JJC) before advancing to the regional stage. Notably, Chen Jia Ming, one of Singapore’s most prolific lyricists in the Mandopop scene, also began his songwriting career as a student at JJC.</p>

<p>
In 2015, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department of JJC, in collaboration with TCR Music Station and Lianhe Zaobao, launched the inaugural “新空下” National Xinyao Singing Competition. This event garnered an overwhelming response from secondary schools and junior colleges, reflecting the enduring appeal of Xinyao. To rejuvenate the legacy of Xinyao, a new songwriting category was introduced in 2017, encouraging students to create original compositions. That same year, the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning joined as a partner, leading to the rebranding of the event as the “新空下” National Schools Xinyao Festival in 2020. Even through the COVID-19 pandemic, the competition adapted its format, continuing to attract students to showcase their talents in both singing and songwriting.</p>
	
<p>
Each year, our CLEP students actively contribute to the event's success behind the scenes. Many have blossomed into budding songwriters, achieving notable recognition in recent competitions. In 2022, two songs, "知多知少" and "筑梦," received 1st and 2nd runner-up awards, while “永远的蝴蝶” earned a Merit Award in 2023. In 2024, our students achieved even greater success, with "他们说" crowned champion and "肆意奔跑" receiving the 2nd runner-up award, while "这一路走来" was honored with a Merit Award.</p>
