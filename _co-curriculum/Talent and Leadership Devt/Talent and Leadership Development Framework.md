The Talent and Leadership Development (TLD) Programme stems from the core belief that every student has talents, interest areas and leadership potential that can be nurtured. The Talent and Leadership Development (TLD) Programme offers opportunities for growth in five key domains: Student Leadership, Academic, Co-curricular Activities (CCA), Values-in-Action (VIA), and Professional Agility. Through these domains, students develop key GRACE competencies which are Growth Mindset, Resilience, Affective Relationships, Cognitive Thinking, and Ethical Decision Making, essential for success in an ever-changing and complex world.

<p>
The TLD framework follows Dr. Treffingerâ€™s Levels of Services Approach, and guides students in setting goals, monitoring and evaluating their own progress through the activities made available to them. As students embark on this journey of discovery, they can develop and excel in their knowledge and skills, and grow into effective leaders who will make positive contributions to our community. </p>
