<h2>Arts Fest</h2>
<p> The Arts Fest was envisioned by the Arts &amp; Aesthetics (A&amp;A) Programme Committee with the aim of facilitating interest discovery through experiential learning while creating arts vibrancy within the college. Therefore, the committee conceptualised an updated lineup of activities for the third edition.

The A&amp;A CCAs and Art students facilitated arts exposure booths for their peers, promoting greater appreciation for the arts encouraging infinite growth. The student committee explored infinite possibilities, by setting up the Visual and Literary Arts exhibition which showcased poems and visual art by JPJC students. They also assisted the lunchtime performances which enlivened the canteen.</p>
