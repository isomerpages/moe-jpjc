<p>Students in this programme plan and organise an annual Leadership Camp for secondary school student leaders, primarily from the West Zone cluster of schools, during the June holidays. This event offers scholars the opportunity to learn how to inspire and impact their juniors, fostering a sense of leadership and responsibility. Through this leadership camp, both the student organisers and secondary school attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how 21st Century Competencies - such as growth mindset, building positive relationships, and ethical decision-making - are essential for their development as student leaders.</p>
