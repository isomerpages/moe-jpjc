<p>JP Spotlight is an annual in-house talent competition showcasing the diverse talents of our JPFam. This year’s Spotlight was themed ‘Press Start!’, which took the JPFAM on a nostalgic journey back to the Y2K era, celebrating all things from music to fashion and computer bugs. The talents showcased were truly impressive, ranging from electrifying dance routines to enchanting harp melodies. </p>

<p>	‘Boss B’ a dance ensemble, emerged as champions with their catchy Y2K song medleys, followed by ‘SNAP’ infusing their performance with Indie Vibes as first runner-up. Second runner-up and Audience Choice Award went to the heart-thumping dance performance by the PowerPuff Girls. Intermissions were equally thrilling, featuring a Tik Tok Dance Battle and renditions of Y2K hit songs by our special Teachers’ Band who has named themselves the “Unknowns”. </p>
