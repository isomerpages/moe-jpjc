<h4><strong>Objectives</strong></h4>
<div align="justify">
<p>
In an interconnected world, fostering civic, global, and cross-cultural literacy is imperative for shaping well-rounded individuals. JPJC recognises the importance of enabling students to engage with diverse perspectives, enhance cultural understanding, and develop a sense of global citizenship for lifelong learning. JP Global Experience is designed to provide students with these opportunities by developing and coordinating internationalisation trips that transcend traditional boundaries—both beyond the classroom and across national borders.</p>

<div align="justify">
<p><b>Diversity</b>: The cornerstone of JP Global Experience lies in the diverse array of internationalisation trips planned. Recognising the importance of individual curiosity and interests, students can customise their overseas learning by selecting trips aligned with their passions. This fosters personalised learning that enhances not only their academic proficiency but also their cultural understanding and global perspectives.</p>
	
<p><b>Interdisciplinary Focus</b>: JP Global Experience offers internationalisation trips with diverse interdisciplinary focuses, fostering a rich spectrum of learning experiences for students. Interdisciplinary education is crucial, as it allows students to explore complex issues from multiple perspectives, breaking down traditional academic silos. By integrating knowledge and methodologies from diverse disciplines, students develop a holistic understanding that enhances critical thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to address real-world challenges in innovative ways.</p>
	
<p><b>School – Industry – Community Partnership</b>: JP Global Experience serves as a catalyst for deepening and enriching students' learning experiences by providing a platform to learn from a diverse array of partners, including overseas schools, communities, and industries. This unique initiative goes beyond conventional educational boundaries, offering students exposure to a variety of skills and competencies essential for different industries and communities worldwide. Collaborations with overseas schools foster cultural exchange and global perspectives, enabling students to appreciate diverse approaches to education while creating opportunities for meaningful cross-cultural connections. Additionally, engaging with industries allows students to gain insights into the practical applications of their academic knowledge, preparing them for the demands of various professional fields.</p>
