<h4><strong>Programmes</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Arts and Social Sciences Day</strong></h5>
<p>
This is a day set aside to create a greater awareness and appreciation of the arts and social sciences. Invited speakers will share their rich knowledge and experiences in their field of expertise such as Economics, History, Political Science, or International Relations. There will also be booths set up by teachers and students to share their personal interest and passion in arts and social sciences with the school.</p>

<h5><strong>The Harvard Innovation Challenge South East Asia</strong></h5>
<p>
The Harvard Innovation Challenge South East Asia is an annual conference co-organised by the Harvard Global Education Movement (HGEM) and the Global Citizen Education Group. The aim of this conference is to guide delegates through the different aspects of international development and help them understand their roles as citizens of the world. To facilitate greater learning and engagement, delegates select one area of focus and participate in discussions and seminar sessions with the relevant influential leaders from the spheres of academia, business and government. After the various workshops, delegates worked in small teams to deliver impactful ‘Solution Proposals’ to tackle real-world problems and generate ideas for future collaborative projects. Our students who attended the conference were enthused and learnt much from their participation. For some, their participation saw them winning awards in different categories such as the Outstanding Delegate Award.</p>
