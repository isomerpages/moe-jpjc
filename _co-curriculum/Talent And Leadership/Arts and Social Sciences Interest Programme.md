<p>
The objectives of the Arts and Social Sciences Interest Programme (ASSIP) are threefold:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To broaden students’ understanding of the arts and social sciences and see the relevance of their learning to the world around them.</li>
	<li>To cultivate interest and passion for the arts and social sciences so that students will enjoy learning of the subjects inside and outside of the classroom.</li>
	<li>To prepare students with the necessary foundational competencies (knowledge, skills, and attitude) in their pursuit of the humanities after graduation.</li></ol>

<p>
Students who enter the college through the DSA (Humanities) pathway are offered direct placement in the ASSIP.  The DSA (Humanities) pathway is open to secondary school students who demonstrate strong interests and ability in the study of Geography, History or Politics. Students in the college can apply to join the ASSIP in Year 1, or participate in ad-hoc learning opportunities on offer by the programme.</p>

	<li><b>Interest-based Research Projects</b><br>
Students have the opportunity to embark on research projects related to their passion and interest. The research process will expose them to the stages of social research/inquiry.</li>
	<li><b>Arts and Social Sciences Day</b><br>
Held in conjunction with STEM Day, the Arts and Social Sciences Day aims to create awareness for the larger school population on the arts and social sciences as well as the inter-disciplinary nature of our world. Students have the opportunity to organise and run the Arts and Social Sciences Day. This is also typically a platform where students share their research findings with the school audience.</li>
	<li><b>ASSIP Modules</b><br>
Students have the opportunity to customize their learning experience by selecting and completing modules of their interests. These modules are broached from different disciplinary vantage points within the broad area of the humanities and social sciences. The module offerings vary across the years, covering a broad range of topics concerning people, societies and social knowledge.</li>
	<li><b>Public Seminars/Lectures/Dialogues</b><br>
Students have the opportunity to attend key public seminars/lectures/dialogues. These public seminars/lectures/dialogues provide them with insights into a broad range of topics concerning people, societies and social knowledge.</li>
	<li><b>Quizzes/Competitions</b><br>
Students have the opportunity to represent the college at national-level quizzes/competitions. One platform is the ASEAN Quiz - a biennial knowledge-based competition focusing on ASEAN’s political, economic, cultural and social developments.</li></ol>

<p>
** There are additional opportunities afforded and these platforms – including learning journeys – both local and overseas – vary from year to year.</p>
