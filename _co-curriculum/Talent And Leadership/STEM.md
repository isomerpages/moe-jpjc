### **STEM**

##### **Committee’s Mission and Vision / Committee’s Objectives**
JPJC’s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) Programme provides opportunities for students to maximise their potential and discover their strengths and passions, in preparation for a possible future in STEM-related careers.

##### **Curriculum**
Through purposefully curated activities targeted mainly at the three levels—**Discover, Develop and Excel**, JPJC seeks to provide students with experiential learning experiences and expose them to knowledge and skills beyond the curriculum. Students will have opportunities to cultivate unique talents and abilities, apply what they have learnt to authentic situations, develop critical thinking & problem solving skills.

Exciting learning journeys to A\*STAR agencies, Lee Kong Chian Natural Museum and Science Centre serve as experiential learning opportunities for our students. Students will learn beyond the classroom and laboratories, where we extend the teaching and learning to the field and higher institutions of learning and research. They also engage with renowned local and overseas scientists to further enhance their knowledge.

Students will also take part in competitions such as National Science Olympiads, SUTD Electric Vehicle Design Challenge and Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition that enrich their knowledge and expose them to higher order thinking.

Students are also able to further their interests in Computing, Mathematics and the Sciences by initiating investigative projects mentored by our teachers and researchers from tertiary institutions. There are also many opportunities for such projects to be presented in prestigious national and international platforms such as the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair and the International Student Science Fair.
