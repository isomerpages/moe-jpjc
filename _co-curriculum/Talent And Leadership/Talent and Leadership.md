The Talent and Leadership Development (TLD) Programme stems from the core belief that every student has talents, interest areas and leadership potential that can be nurtured. This programme provides a wide range of opportunities to encourage the pursuit of interests and development of leadership capabilities. The TLD framework follows Dr. Treffingerâ€™s Levels of Services Approach, and guides students in setting goals, monitoring and evaluating their own progress through the activities made available to them.</p>

<p>
As students embark on this journey of discovery, they can develop and excel in their knowledge and skills, and grow into effective leaders who will make positive contributions to our community.</p>
