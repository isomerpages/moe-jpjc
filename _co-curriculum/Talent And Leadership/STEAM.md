<h4>Discover</h4>

<p>Enrichment opportunities (e.g. talks, workshops, seminars, learning journeys to industries, tertiary education and research institutions) expose students to knowledge and skills beyond the classroom and provide a foundation for students to discover their strengths and interests in STEAM, research and innovation.</p>
	
<h4>Develop</h4>

<p>Competitions such as Horizons Hydrogen Grand Prix and Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition allow students to deepen and apply STEAM and problem-solving skills to authentic contexts. For students who have strong interest in innovation and entrepreneurship, there are also workshops and competitions organised by Junior Achievement which they can participate in. 
</p>
	
<h4>Excel</h4>
	
<p>
Students are also able to further their interests in STEAM by embarking on research or initiating investigative projects mentored by our teachers and researchers from tertiary institutions. There are also many opportunities for such projects to be presented in prestigious national and international platforms such as the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, International Elementz Fair and the International Humanities Symposium.</p>
