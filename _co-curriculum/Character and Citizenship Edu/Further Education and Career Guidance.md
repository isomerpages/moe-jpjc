<h6><strong>1) Who am I? (Awareness)</strong></h6>
<p>
Deepening awareness of self-identity and of opportunities and resources available for higher education and career planning</p>

<h6><strong>2) Where am I going? (Exploration)</strong></h6>
<p>
	Exploring higher education and career options through experiential learning</p>

<h6><strong>3) How do I get there? (Planning and Transiting)</strong></h6>
<p>
Acquiring knowledge and skills to make informed decisions regarding higher education and career options</p>
