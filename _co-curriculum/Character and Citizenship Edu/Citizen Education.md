### **Citizen Education**
The college aims to develop students who are culturally sensitive, socially responsible with a global outlook and a strong sense of rootedness to Singapore.

The college cultivates citizenship dispositions in students through:

*   Discussion of contemporary issues specific to citizenship in CCE and IP lessons.
*   Engaging students through key student development experiences. (e.g. NE Commemorative Days, SG Perspectives, workshops, VIA and learning journeys).
*   Empowering student leaders to facilitate discussion of contemporary issues and organise NE-related activities.
