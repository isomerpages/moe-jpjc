<p>The Citizen Education programme aims to develop students to be culturally sensitive, concerned and socially responsible citizens with a global outlook and a strong sense of rootedness to Singapore. The programme seeks to cultivate the citizenship dispositions in our students (sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singaporeâ€™s vulnerabilities and constraints, which translates to the will to act on improving the lives of others and building a future for our nation) using the following approaches:</p>

<ul><li>Engaging our students in conversations during the CCE and academic subject lessons allow them to share perspectives and discuss contemporary issues and public policies in a conducive environment.</li><ul>

The college cultivates citizenship dispositions in students through:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Discussion of contemporary issues specific to citizenship in CCE and IP lessons.</li>
	<li>Engaging students through key student development experiences. (e.g. NE Commemorative Days, SG Perspectives, workshops, VIA and learning journeys).</li>
	<li>Empowering student leaders to facilitate discussion of contemporary issues and organise NE-related activities.</li></ul>
