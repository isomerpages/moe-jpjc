### **Values in Action**
<div align=justify>
<p>
Our college aims to nurture a community of compassionate leaders with a heart to serve through the following:
<ul>
	<li>Developing students’ awareness of community needs through discussing social issues during CCE lessons and CCAs; and by engaging with community partners and Social Service Agencies (SSA).</li></ul>

The college organises the Service Learning Festival annually to provide platform for our students to interact with the advocates from various Social Service Agencies. Through the interaction with the presenters, it enabled our students to have a better understanding on the social causes by these SSA, the community’s needs and volunteering opportunities available for them to volunteer.</strong></figcaption>

For example, our students conducted a series of virtual workshops for the elderly of Taman Jurong, Jurong Spring and Nanyang. The topics of these workshops included the use of mobile apps for transport booking, food ordering, photo editing, and promoting awareness of scam prevention; and other hands-on workshops like terrarium-making and handicraft-making.</strong></figcaption>
