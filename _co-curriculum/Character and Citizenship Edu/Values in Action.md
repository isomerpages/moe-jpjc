<p>The Service Learning (SL) programme serves to inculcate a sense of social and civic responsibility in the students by getting them to learn through serving the college and community. With the mission to nurture a community of compassionate leaders with a heart to serve, the college adopts a whole-school approach to SL of which all students are encouraged to participate or lead in Values-In-Action (VIA) projects through the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing students’ awareness on the community needs through discussion of community and social issues in CCE lessons and CCAs.</li>

<li>Raising awareness on volunteerism through sharing sessions by community partners and providing opportunities for the students to volunteer within school and/or community through collaboration with community partners.</li></ul>

<p>Students from Community Engagement Council and Interact Club initiated VIA projects to show their appreciation to our support staff and contract cleaners in our college. For example, presenting goodie bags to them during festive seasons, and sharing by the staff on their hobbies for the college to know them better.</p>
