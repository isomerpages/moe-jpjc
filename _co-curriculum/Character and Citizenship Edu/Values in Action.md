<p>The Service Learning (SL) programme serves to inculcate a sense of social and civic responsibility in the students by getting them to learn through serving the college and community. With the mission to nurture a community of compassionate leaders with a heart to serve, the college adopts a whole-school approach to SL of which all students are encouraged to participate or lead in Values-In-Action (VIA) projects through the following approaches:
<ul>
<li>Developing students’ awareness on the community needs through discussion of community and social issues in CCE lessons and CCAs.</li>

<li>Raising awareness on volunteerism through sharing sessions by community partners and providing opportunities for the students to volunteer within school and/or community through collaboration with community partners.</li>
