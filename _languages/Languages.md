The Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department aims to nurture active learners who are able to use their mother tongue (Chinese, Malay or Tamil) languages to communicate proficiently in everyday life. We strive to help our students understand and develop their cultural identity through a deeper appreciation of the mother tongue languages, literature and culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;For students with a strong inclination towards their respective mother tongue languages and related aspects, our department also offers H2 subjects which would help open doors to, as well as acquire the awareness and deep appreciation of literature, writing, global issues and current affairs.</p></div>
