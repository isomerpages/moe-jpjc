<p>
The department aims to nurture our students to be confident users of their respective MTL, to better appreciate their culture and values, and to develop an interest for the language. The H1 MTL curriculum will promote engaged learning through discussions, presentations and assessments that are interactive and encourage confidence in self-expression. Emphasis will be put on the use of the language in authentic situations. Students will leverage on e-learning platforms such as web-based iMTL, SLS to enhance their oral, reading, self-directed learning and collaborative capabilities. Students will also be given opportunities to participate in enrichment programmes beyond the classroom, such as the HSK Proficiency Test, MTL Fortnight, Xinyao Song Singing and Writing Competition, MTL publications and local/overseas experiential learning programmes.</p>
