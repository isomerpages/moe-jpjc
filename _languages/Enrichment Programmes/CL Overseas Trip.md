### **CL Overseas Trip**
<div align=justify>
<p>
The objectives of our CL overseas trips are manifold – ranging from immersing in the Mandarin speaking environment, developing students’ 21st century competencies such as global awareness and cross-cultural sensitivities, to exposing students to the rapid developments in the outside world beyond the confines of the classroom.</p>
<p>
Our CL overseas trips are always an enriching and memorable experience for students and teachers. The students’ take away not just fond memories of the times spent with one another, but more importantly, a deeper understanding and appreciation of Chinese history, culture and literary works, alongside the technological transformation and rapid economic development of China.</p>
