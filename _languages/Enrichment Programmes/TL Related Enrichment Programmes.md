<p>Students taking Tamil Language (H1) have opportunities to engage in Tamil Language and Culture related workshops, seminars, language competitions, cultural activities and Indian dance to enhance their authentic and rich learning experiences beyond the classroom.</p>

<p>
As part of Tamil Language learning, students can look forward to authentic and rich learning experiences by participating in activities such as the Budding Poets’ Programme (Naanum Oru Padaippaali) organised by Tamil Language Unit of Curriculum Planning and Development Division, MOE and Tamil Language Pre-University Seminar organised by Yishun Innova Junior College (YIJC) and ‘Agni’ competitions organised by Anderson Serangoon Junior College (ASRJC).</p>
 
<p>Furthermore, students can look forward to cultural experiences planned and organised by our college during Mother Tongue Fortnight (MTF) activities, Racial Harmony Day (RHD) and other festive celebrations.</p>
	
<p>In addition, the college arranges for students to attend the Tamil Language Teaching Scholarship Tea Session organised by MOE in collaboration with National Institute of Education (NIE) for interested and potential students to take up Tamil Language teaching as a career.</p>
