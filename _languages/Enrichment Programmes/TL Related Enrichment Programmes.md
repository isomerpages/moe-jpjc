### **TL Related Enrichment Programmes**
Students taking Tamil Language (H1) and Tamil Language and Literature (H2) have the opportunities to engage in Tamil Language and Cultural workshops, seminars, language competitions, cultural activities and Indian dance to enhance their authentic learning experience beyond classroom.

As part of the Tamil Language authentic learning experience, students can look forward to activities such as: Tamil Language Pre-University Seminar organised by Yishun Innova Junior College (YIJC), the Budding Poets’ Programme (Naanum Oru Padaippaali) and the Tamil Translation Workshop organised by Tamil Language Unit of Curriculum Planning and Development Division, MOE.
 
In addition, the college organises the Tamil Language Teaching Scholarship Talk by MOE in collaboration with National Institute of Education (NIE) for potential students to take up Tamil Language teaching as a career.
 
The college also identifies students for the National Elective Tamil Language programme (NETP) which is a scholarship programme conducted at Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre (UPTLC). The NETP programme aims to nurture students who have an aptitude in the Tamil Language to acquire greater proficiency in the language with deeper appreciation of the language, literature and culture.
