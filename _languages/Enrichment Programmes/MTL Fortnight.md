With the combined efforts from all three language units, a variety of activities are organised to create an immersive environment for the learning and appreciation of Mother Tongue Languages; to provide platforms for students to actively learn them and the associated culture; to provide authentic opportunities for students to use the languages and experience the culture.</p>
