	<li> MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS)</li>

	<li>Gross Household Income (GHI) not exceeding $2,750 per month OR</li>
	<li>Per Capita Income (PCI)\* not exceeding $690 per month</li></p>

*PCI is computed by dividing the gross household income by the number of members in the same household. Household members include the student, his/her parents, grandparents, and unmarried siblings living at the same address. Other dependents living at the same address may be included on a case-by-case basis.
</p>
