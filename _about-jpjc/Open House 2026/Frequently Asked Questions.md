<h3>Admission</h3>
<h5><b>1. What are the cut-off points for JPJC?</b></h5>

<p>For reference, the 2025 L1R5 cut-off point for the Arts Stream was 15, and for the Science Stream, 14. The cut-off point for admission to JPJC in 2026 will be released after the conclusion of JAE 2026.</p>

<h3>About JPJC</h3>
<h5><b>1. How is JPJC’s culture like?</b></h5>

<p>JPJC’s <a href="/about/college-identity/culture/">culture</a> is centred around the JPJC Family—JPFam for short. Everyone—students, teachers, staff, and key stakeholders such as parents and alumni—is part of this family.</p>

<p>To provide clarity on the actions that contribute to our desired culture, this has been further distilled into the Infinite series:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Infinite Love: Students are encouraged to show empathy, respect, and consideration for others. JPFam creates a safe and inclusive space where everyone feels valued and supported. Helping and supporting peers, just as our staff care for students. Celebrating achievements strengthens the sense of belonging for JPFam.</li>
	<li>Infinite Growth: Students are encouraged to adopt a growth mindset and see learning as a lifelong journey. JPFam nurtures resilience and a willingness to embrace challenges, helping students grow in confidence and skills.</li>
	<li>Infinite Possibilities: Collaboration, problem-solving, innovation, and creativity are hallmarks of the JPFam. </li></ul>
	<p>JPFam’s spirit reflects the college motto, <i>“While I Live, I Learn. Plus Ultra,”</i>i inspiring students to explore beyond their comfort zones.</p>

<h5><b>2. What is the 2024 cut-off point for JPJC?	</b></h5>
<p>For reference, the 2024 L1R5 cut-off point for the Science Stream is 14 and the Arts Stream is 15. The 2025 cut-off point for JPJC will only be made available after JAE 2025.</p>


<h5><b> 3. My preferred subject combination is not listed on the college website. Will I be able to choose my preferred subject combination?</b></h5>
<p>JPJC provides a wide range of subject combinations to cater to students’ personal interests, abilities and future career choices. Take a look <a href="https://www.jpjc.moe.edu.sg/about/subject-combination/">here</a> and find one that best suits your needs and aspirations.</p>


<h5><b>4. How do I appeal for admission to the college?</b></h5>
<p>Students who would like to appeal should complete an online application which will be made available on the school’s website. The college will contact shortlisted applicants for an interview. We seek your understanding that the college will not be accepting walk-in appeals as of now.</p>



<h5><b>5. What is the selection process like for Student Council? How many days do we need to commit for student council if we were to take it?</b></h5>
<p>The selection process involves two stages: (a) the preliminary interview, followed by (b) the student polls. Shortlisted students from the preliminary interview will be placed into campaigning groups, who will then engage the student population through various means in order to get their support/vote. After a week, the JC1 cohort will then cast their votes and the number of votes received will be considered with other factors before a student is formally accepted into the Student Council.</p>

<p>The Student Council conducts CCA sessions twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays. As the CCA sees to large-scale projects or programmes such as the OGL Camp, Matriculation and Orientation programme, Teachers’ Day celebration and Graduation Night, Student Councilors may be called back on additional days for small-scale testing, rehearsals or other preparatory work etc. in preparation for these events.</p>

<p>On top of that, Student Councilors will be involved in leadership workshop or camps, together with other CCA leaders, organised by the College.</p>

<h5><b>6. How many days are CCA Days and what are the timings?</b></h5><p></p>
<p> In general, the college CCA days are designated on Wednesdays (3pm - 6pm) and Fridays (4pm to 7pm). Depending on the nature of the CCA and activities, the duration of the CCA activities will last between 2-3 hours per session.</p></div></div>
