b. [How posting works](https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae/explore-pathways-and-understand-the-posting-process/how-posting-works)
	
<h5><b>1. What are the cut-off points for JPJC?</b></h5>

<p>For reference, the L1R5 Net Aggregate Range for 2026 JAE for the Arts Stream was 9 to 14, and for the Science Stream, 4 to 14.</p>

<p>We encourage students to consider JPJC holistically, taking into account not just academic results but also the college’s culture, support structures, and programmes.</p>
	
<h3>About JPJC</h3>
<h5><b>1. How is JPJC’s culture like?</b></h5>

<p>JPJC’s <a href="/about/college-identity/culture/">culture</a> is centred around the JPJC Family—JPFam for short. Everyone—students, teachers, staff, and key stakeholders such as parents and alumni—is part of this family.</p>

<p>To provide clarity on the actions that contribute to our desired culture, this has been further distilled into the Infinite series:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Infinite Love: Students are encouraged to show empathy, respect, and consideration for others. JPFam creates a safe and inclusive space where everyone feels valued and supported. Helping and supporting peers, just as our staff care for students. Celebrating achievements strengthens the sense of belonging for JPFam.</li>
	<li>Infinite Growth: Students are encouraged to adopt a growth mindset and see learning as a lifelong journey. JPFam nurtures resilience and a willingness to embrace challenges, helping students grow in confidence and skills.</li>
	<li>Infinite Possibilities: Collaboration, problem-solving, innovation, and creativity are hallmarks of the JPFam. </li></ul>
	<p>JPFam’s spirit reflects the college motto, <i>“While I Live, I Learn. Plus Ultra,”</i> inspiring students to explore beyond their comfort zones.</p>
	
<h3>Subject Combinations</h3>
<h5><b>1. What subject combinations are available in JPJC?</b></h5>
	
<p>JPJC offers a wide and flexible range of subject combinations (over 100) to support students with diverse interests, strengths, and future aspirations. We encourage students to explore the <a href="/about/subject-combination/">subject combinations</a> available and select one that best aligns with their learning interests and long-term goals.</p>
	
<h5><b>2. If I am taking Combined Science, can I still take two H2 sciences?</b></h5>
	
<p>For students with Science (Chemistry/Biology), Science (Physics/Chemistry), Science (Physics/Biology), who are opting to do the subject combination of either H2 Mathematics, H2 Chemistry, H2 Biology OR H2 Mathematics, H2 Chemistry, H2 Physics, it is preferred that students should obtain
</p><ul>
	<li>Distinction in the Combined Science with the two relevant Science disciplines, OR</li>
	<li>a pass in the relevant Pure Science and Combined Science.</li></ul><p></p>
	
<h5><b>3. Can I take H2 Mathematics if I did not take Additional Mathematics?</b></h5>
	
<p>It is possible, but students may find the transition demanding. Bridging lessons will be provided to help students adjust. Students who prefer a more gradual progression may choose to take H1 Mathematics instead.</p>
	
<h3>Timetable</h3>
<h5><b>1. What is the timetable like in JPJC?</b></h5>
	
<p>Given the wide variety of subject combinations (over 100) offered to cater to students’ diverse interests, lessons may span the whole day. Instead of fixed recess or lunch periods, students have breaks of 30 minutes or longer built into their timetable.</p>

<p>Students are coached to develop good habits under our Self-Regulation Guide and are encouraged to make good use of these breaks—not only for academic learning but also for co-curricular involvement and personal development. These experiences help students build important life and soft skills that are valuable beyond the classroom.</p>

<p>Self-Directed Learning (SDL) Days are integrated into the curriculum. SDL days nurture independent, self-directed, and lifelong learners by giving students space to learn at their own pace and explore interests beyond the curriculum.</p>

<h3>University Admission Requirements</h3>
<h5><b>1. Do I still need to take a H1 contrasting subject since it will not be counted?</b></h5>

<p>Yes, a H1 contrasting subject is still required. We encourage students to view it as an opportunity to broaden their interests and gain exposure to different ways of thinking and skillsets. If a student attains a good grade, the H1 subject can also improve their University Admission Score (UAS).</p>
	
<h5><b>2. What happens if I fail Mother Tongue (MT) or Project Work (PW)?</b></h5>

<p>Students who do not pass MT or PW will not be eligible for admission to local autonomous universities.</p>

<p>Please refer to the respective university websites to learn more about their admission criteria, expectations, and requirements.</p>

<h5><b>2. Is participation in CCA compulsory in JPJC?</b></h5>
	
<p>While <a href="/jpjc-experience/co-curriculum/talent-n-leadership-development-programme/co-curricular-activities/">CCAs</a> are not compulsory, participation is strongly encouraged.</p> 

<p>Universities are increasingly adopting a holistic approach to admissions, where academic results are considered alongside students’ interests, aptitudes, and experiences. Applicants are required to list achievements in CCAs or non-academic activities (such as volunteering or sports).</p>

<p>CCAs provide valuable opportunities for students to discover their interests, develop character, and grow beyond academics.</p>

<h5><b>3. How many days are CCA days and what are the timings?</b></h5>
	
<p>CCA sessions are generally held on Wednesdays and Fridays from 3:30 pm. Depending on the nature of the CCA, sessions typically last between 2 to 3 hours.</p> 
	
<h5><b>4. What is the selection process for the Student Council?</b></h5>
	
<p>The selection process comprises two stages:<br>
a) a preliminary interview, followed by<br>
b) student polling after the campaigning period, where candidates engage the student population to share their ideas and vision.<br>
Student Councillors hold CCA sessions twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays.</p> 
	
<p>As the Student Council oversees large-scale college events such as Orientation, Teachers’ Day celebrations, and Graduation Night, councillors may occasionally be called back on additional days for planning and rehearsals. They also participate in leadership workshops and camps organised by the college, alongside student leaders from other CCAs.</p>

<h5><b>5. What is the selection process like for Student Council? How many days do we need to commit for student council if we were to take it?</b></h5>
<p>The selection process involves two stages: (a) the preliminary interview, followed by (b) the student polls. Shortlisted students from the preliminary interview will be placed into campaigning groups, who will then engage the student population through various means in order to get their support/vote. After a week, the JC1 cohort will then cast their votes and the number of votes received will be considered with other factors before a student is formally accepted into the Student Council.</p>

<p>The Student Council conducts CCA sessions twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays. As the CCA sees to large-scale projects or programmes such as the OGL Camp, Matriculation and Orientation programme, Teachers’ Day celebration and Graduation Night, Student Councilors may be called back on additional days for small-scale testing, rehearsals or other preparatory work etc. in preparation for these events.</p>

<p>On top of that, Student Councilors will be involved in leadership workshop or camps, together with other CCA leaders, organised by the College.</p>

<h5><b>6. How many days are CCA Days and what are the timings?</b></h5><p></p>
<p> In general, the college CCA days are designated on Wednesdays (3pm - 6pm) and Fridays (4pm to 7pm). Depending on the nature of the CCA and activities, the duration of the CCA activities will last between 2-3 hours per session.</p></div></div>
