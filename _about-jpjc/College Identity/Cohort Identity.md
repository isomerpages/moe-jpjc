<p>The lighthouse, beacon, and ship symbolise the school's steadfast support, guidance, and reassurance to the cohort. They represent the passing on of knowledge to aid others, akin to beacons guiding ships. Rephrased for clarity and grammatical precision, akin to beacons guiding ships. The figures on the lighthouse embody unity within the JPfam, offering unwavering support throughout life's journey.</p><br>

<p>Building on their orientation theme, the cohort aimed for the skies as they completed their studies at JPJC. It also coincided with breaking free from the restrictions brought about by the Covid Pandemic. Themed ‘Celestial’, each house represented a planet in their house color and pinned their messages on buttons creating a vibrant and colorful canvas.</p>

<p>The combination of the compass and six house symbols represents a collective effort towards a common goal with a well-defined direction. The compass symbolises guidance the cohort on their journey, while the individual houses contribute distinct elements to the overarching mission. The logo conveys a strong sense of unity and purpose within the cohort. </p><br>

<p>Coined as the Covid batch the cohort spent most of their time with minimal interaction with their peers. As such, this identity was created to symbolise breaking away from Covid. To unify them, they engaged in making origami based on the animals representing their respective houses. The classes also collaborated to help one another complete their individual pieces. Each origami piece also carried a personal message from its creator, resulting in a truly colorful masterpiece, imbued with everyone’s personal touch.</p><br>

<p>Like a tree, the cohort has grown through their experiences in JPJC  and possesses the potential to thrive in the face of challenges. Rooted in the ground (JPJC), the JP experience will always remain a part of them, no matter where they go. </p>
