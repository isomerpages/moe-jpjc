 Different paths we had before, now together we will soar. <br>
Boundless love, endless growth. <br>
Serve with zest, open our doors.

As dawn breaks, we rise up high.<br>
There's no limit in the sky. <br>
Forward we go, we will grow. <br>
Hand in hand we light the trail.

While I live, I learn. In heart and mind, I'll grow. <br>
With heart and voice, we venture. <br>
We'll cross all new frontiers.<br>
In our hearts the flame ignites,<br>
_Plus Ultra_  we set our sights. <br>
Brave the odds, blaze the trail. <br>
JP always strives as one.<br>
Brave the odds, blaze the trail.<br> 
JP always strives as one.
