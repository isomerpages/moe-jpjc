<p>The story behind our college anthem, Crescendo, captures the spirit of unity, growth, and resilience, celebrating our journey as JPFam - coming together from diverse paths to pursue a shared vision. The lyrics convey a commitment to lifelong learning and an open-hearted approach to embracing new challenges. Key themes include boundless love, collective ambition, and courage in facing the unknown. The line "While I live, I learn" highlights the value of continuous personal and intellectual growth, while "Plus Ultra" embodies an aspiration to transcend limits.&nbsp;</p>

  

<p>Crescendo symbolises a united JPFam, supporting one another, overcoming obstacles, and striving together toward ever-greater heights.</p><p>

  

</p><p>Written and composed by Nicholas Oh Jia Jun (19S15), performed by the JP Choir.</p>

 Different paths we had before, now together we will soar.<br>
Boundless love,&nbsp;endless growth.&nbsp;<br>
Serve with zest, open our doors.</p>

<p>As dawn breaks, we rise up high.<br>
There's no limit in the sky.&nbsp;<br>
Forward we go, we will grow.&nbsp;<br>
Hand in hand we&nbsp;light the trail.</p>

<p>While I live, I learn. In heart and mind, I'll grow.&nbsp;<br>
With heart and voice, we venture.&nbsp;<br>
We'll cross all new frontiers.<br>
In our hearts the flame ignites,<br>
<i><strong>Plus Ultra</strong></i>&nbsp;we set our sights.&nbsp;<br>
Brave the odds, blaze the trail.&nbsp;<br>
JP always strives as one.<br>
Brave the odds, blaze the trail.<br>
JP always&nbsp;strives as one.</p></center>
