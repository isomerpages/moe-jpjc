Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) crest is the fusion of the letters ‘J’ and ‘P’ – the first letter of the names of our predecessors. It is a deliberate tribute to the legacy and values upon which JPJC is established, where we inherit our unyielding dedication to the passion to learn and the spirit of seeking personal excellence.

The letters are melded to form the shape of an infinite loop ─ unceasing, never-ending and limitless. The swirl connotes fluidity and flexibility, symbolising our students’ versatility in adapting to an ever-changing world.

The JPJC crest signifies the College’s immense commitment to our mission, and encapsulates our hopes for our students. It also embodies our values and beliefs:

JPJC believes that every child has limitless capacity for growth and is dedicated to helping each child develop his potential to become his best.

##### **Infinite possibilities**.

JPJC values perseverance, resilience and humility. Together, they result in an indomitable character with an unceasing pursuit for improvement of self and betterment of community.

##### **Infinite growth**.

JPJC seeks to nurture respectful and compassionate leaders who are critical and creative thinkers, and serve responsibly in service of others.

##### **Infinite love**.

The colours of the crest emanate passion for growth, learning and giving, being anchored by depth of thinking and steadfastness. Maroon radiates intensity of passion and courage, representing strength and warmth. Dark blue symbolises intelligence and wisdom. It also exudes confidence and equanimity. The two colours intertwine to create a constant flow of JPJC’s ideals, mutually enhancing and empowering.

The crest is a constant reminder to all in JPJC of our origins. More importantly, it is our emblem of hope and promise for the future.
