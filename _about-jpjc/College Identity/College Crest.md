<p>		 
Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) crest is the fusion of the letters ‘J’ and ‘P’ – the first letter of the names of our predecessors. It is a deliberate tribute to the legacy and values upon which JPJC is established, where we inherit our unyielding dedication to the passion to learn and the spirit of seeking personal excellence. 
</p>

<p>
The letters are melded to form the shape of an infinite loop ─ unceasing, never-ending and limitless. The swirl connotes fluidity and flexibility, symbolising our students’ versatility in adapting to an ever-changing world.

The JPJC crest signifies the College’s immense commitment to our mission, and encapsulates our hopes for our students. It also embodies our values and beliefs:
