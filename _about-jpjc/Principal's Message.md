As COVID-19 continues to bring disruption to our society, we have entered one of our most, if not most prolonged crisis since independence. Now, more than ever, we need to raise ourselves above the uncertainty, turbulence and setbacks the pandemic has thrown at us. At a time when many schools worldwide had closed for months, schools in Singapore had dealt with this crisis head on, without letting it discourage us. Both teachers and students adapted courageously to the way we live, work and learn. </p>

Indeed, JPJC had seized the opportunity to reflect on our teaching and learning practices early, embarking on a journey of blended learning. Our students had adjusted admirably to a new way of learning, rising to the occasion. What the pandemic has taught us is that life is unpredictable, but one constant that we must all embrace is the need to continuously learn, unlearn and relearn in order to tackle what lies ahead. Equally crucial, in these difficult times and beyond, self-regulation is key to our approach to learning and living. </p>

To all current JC1 and JC2 students, learning does not just end when you embark on and complete the journey in the next institute of higher learning. It is not just about chasing the last distinction or the next practical or lucrative course you undertake. What you must do is to find the joy in seeing and learning new things and embracing the future, taking it as it comes. The COVID-19 pandemic is not the first nor the last crisis we faced and will face as a nation. Have the confidence, the conviction and courage in knowing that we have overcome many before, and we will do it again. </p>

It is said that coldest is the hour before dawn breaks; and when it does, we will <i><strong>Rise up High, and Together We Will Soar.</strong></i>
