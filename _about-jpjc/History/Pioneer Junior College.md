Pioneer Junior College (PJC) was established in 1999 and opened its doors to its first cohort of students on 2 January 2000 at a holding site located along Science Centre Road, under the leadership of its first Principal, Mr Kwek Hiok Chuang. It was in 2004 that the college moved into its permanent home at 21 Teck Whye Walk and was officially declared open by the then Education Minister Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam.

The young and budding college, armed with the belief that every student who enters its gates could certainly be developed to his or her fullest potential, revolved its work around student development. With this conviction, the college upheld the twin pillars of academic excellence and character development. Bearing the fruit of her labour, the college flourished from strength to strength to become a safe abode for a family of committed learners and compassionate leaders. The love and care of the college’s teachers touched many hearts of students and won parents’ affirmation for and trust in the college as an institution which puts the students right at the heart of education and enabled them to excel above expectations.

Planted firmly on this strong foundation, PJC proved to be well able to hold its own, standing tall in the ranks amongst the giants, pioneering new growth areas and achieving significant breakthroughs. Shortly after Mrs Tan-Kek Lee Yong took over the helm on 15 December 2005 to become the college’s second Principal, the college organised the Ministry of Education (MOE) Pre-University Seminar 2007 which saw the inaugural participation of the polytechnics and Integrated Programme schools, marking a milestone development in the history of MOE Pre-University Seminar. In 2008, PJC initiated its Engaging China Programme for its students to be China-ready and forged collaborations with top Chinese universities (Fudan University, Xiamen University and Zhejiang University) and partnerships with many Chinese educational institutions and companies to open doors for Pioneers to venture into the emerging superpower. The programme was further augmented with the introduction of a new ‘A’ Level subject, China Studies in English, in PJC and the development of the China Ready Index tool by the college. In 2012, the college was selected by MOE as the third JC centre for Malay Language Elective Programme.

In her relatively short 19 years of history and growth, PJC had achieved outstanding outcomes, affirmed by notable key awards:

*   **Sustained Achievement Award for Academic Value-Added (since 2009), an award that recognises the college’s ability in consistently enabling students to achieve results above expectations**
*   **Outstanding Development Award in Character Development (2010), an award that recognises the college’s efforts, processes and structures to develop good character in students.**
*   **Best Practice Award for Teaching & Learning (2010), an award that recognises the college’s sustained excellence in teaching & learning**
*   **School Distinction Award (2010), an award that recognises the college’s exemplary school processes and practices.**
*   **Outstanding Development Award for National Education (2012), an award that recognises the college’s efforts to develop in our students the instinct for survival, national cohesion and confidence in our future.**

Other awards that the college continued to sustain over the years: 

*   **Sustained Achievement Award for Aesthetics**
*   **National Arts Education Award (SPARKS)**
*   **Cherish Award**
*   **LOTUS Excellent Schools’ Green Audit Award**
*   **Partners’ Merit Award**

The college had also produced four Public Service Commission scholars and a President’s Scholar, inspiring generations of Pioneers to achieve goals once thought unsurmountable; and nurturing resilient leaders who are empowered to make a positive difference. The strong college spirit that rallied staff and students together was a testimony as to how Pioneers sowed the seeds for their future; the unyielding spirit – ‘Always Serving, Always Learning’ – emblazoned across their hearts.

#### **The College Crest**

##### **Introduction**
The PJC logo represents the emergence of a new spirit of creativity and flexibility within the parameters of conventions and norms. These are qualities embodied in the spirit of the college of the new millennium - Pioneer Junior College.

##### **Design**
The right angles extol virtues of integrity and fortitude, while the obtuse angles, as well as the protruding edge, signify the Pioneer's willingness to extend his thinking beyond the bounds of accepted practices by adopting a spirit of adventure and entrepreneurship. The upward thrust of the two coloured bands points to the eagerness of the Pioneer to look ahead to the future, while being anchored firmly in the core values of the past. The 62-degree angle created at the joining of the 2 coloured bands is deliberate; it represents the 62 teaching and non-teaching staff who started the College on 1 Dec 1999.

##### **Colours**
The image of a blank, white canvas epitomises the openness of attitude with which the Pioneer accepts differences in perspective. Charcoal connotes the 'fuel of knowledge'; as the fuel is burnt, the 'fires of learning', as represented by Vermilion, are ignited. This fire burns with youthful energy and passion, attributes that the Pioneer must possess as he forges ahead with a pioneering spirit.

**Verse I**<br>
Here I stand <br>
The dawning of a brand new day <br>

**Verse 2**<br>
Here we stand <br>
Together on this special day <br>

All our hearts share the spirit of exploring <br>
In our lives we will always show <br>
How we've set our sights on soaring <br>
While we live, we learn and grow. <br>

**Chorus:**<br>
And we'll seek and explore <br>
Open each and every door <br>
Always caring and faithful and true <br>

With conviction we take every turn <br>
This passion we will hold <br>
So that everyone may know <br>
We believe: While we live, we learn.
