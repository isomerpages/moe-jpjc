The History unit seeks to nurture curiosity in students about the past and to equip them with analytical and critical thinking skills to make informed judgments of the past and better understand the present. We also strive to develop in students a deep understanding of historical concepts and emphasise the distinctive ways of thinking that characterises the discipline of History.
