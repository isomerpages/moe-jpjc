<h5>Enrichment Programmes mounted by the History Unit</h5>

<ol>
<li><b>Competitions and Quizzes</b></li>
<p>The History Unit identifies and trains interested students for related competitions such as the History Bee and Bowl Asian Division as well as the Biennial ASEAN Quiz. These competitions provide participants opportunities to work together in teams as well as deepen their knowledge and skills in areas they are passionate in.</p>

<p>The History Unit also identifies and trains interested JC1 and JC2 students for various MUN and SMC events held throughout the year to allow for a better understanding of these organisations as well as to hone perspective taking.</p>

<li><b>Learning Journeys and Speaker Series</b></li>
	
<p>The History Unit also utilises placed-based learning by organising learning journeys to sites such as the National University of Singapore and the Parliament House.&nbsp;

At NUS, students engage with academic historians and explore the discipline beyond the classroom. Our History students had the privilege of stepping onto the NUS campus, where they interacted with undergraduates pursuing History and engaged in meaningful conversations with an esteemed History Professor. This gave them a taste of university life and a deeper appreciation of what it means to study History at the tertiary level.</p>

<p>They also have the opportunity to observe governance in action through visits to Parliament during its sittings, gaining first-hand insight into the workings of parliamentary democracy and the legislative process. In addition, students attend talks by invited speakers, which further broaden their understanding of historical inquiry and its contemporary relevance.</p>

<p>In addition, students attend <b>talks by invited speakers</b>, which further broaden their understanding of historical inquiry and its contemporary relevance. Professor Bruce Lockhart, a distinguished scholar from NUS FASS, delivered a lecture on <i>The Pursuit of National Unity in Post-Independent Southeast Asia</i> â€” a key theme in the A-Level syllabus. His rich insights, wit, and charisma captivated our students, leaving them both enlightened and inspired.</p>

<li><b>History through Culture</b></li>

<p>Students are also encouraged to experience history through the performing arts. The History Unit organised attendance at international and local theatre performances such as Miss Saigon and Yusof, which allow students to examine how historical narratives, identity, and social issues are portrayed through performance. These experiences complement classroom learning by fostering empathy, cultural awareness, and a deeper appreciation of historical context.</p>
