<h5>Enrichment Programmes mounted by the History Unit</h5>

<p>One of the highlights of our enrichment programmes this year was an inspiring learning journey to the NUS Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASS). Our History students had the privilege of stepping onto the NUS campus, where they interacted with undergraduates pursuing History and engaged in meaningful conversations with an esteemed History Professor. This gave them a taste of university life and a deeper appreciation of what it means to study History at the tertiary level.</p>

<p>We were also especially honoured to host Professor Bruce Lockhart, a distinguished scholar from NUS FASS, who delivered a lecture on The Pursuit of National Unity in Post-Independent Southeast Asia — a key theme in the A-Level syllabus. His rich insights, wit, and charisma captivated our students, leaving them both enlightened and inspired.</p>

<p>At the end of 2025, J1 H2 History students will attend a theatrical production entitled “Yusof”, which brings to life the story of Singapore’s first President, Mr Yusof Ishak. This follows last year’s impactful viewing of “Miss Saigon”, which deepened their understanding of the Vietnam War — another central topic in the syllabus.</p>
