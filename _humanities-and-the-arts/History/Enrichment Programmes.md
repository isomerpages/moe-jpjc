##### **1)    Competitions/Quizzes**
The Unit identifies and trains interested students for related competitions such as the History Bee and Bowl Asian Division as well as the Biennial ASEAN Quiz. These competitions provide participants opportunities to work together in teams as well as deepen their knowledge and skills in areas they are passionate in.
