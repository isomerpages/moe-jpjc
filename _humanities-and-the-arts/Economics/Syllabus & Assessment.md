<h4><strong>Assessment for Learning</strong></h4>
<p>Formative assessments are conducted during the course of instruction by the JPJC Economics Department to monitor students' learning progress, diagnose learning difficulties and provide feedback on areas that need improvement. The modes of formative assessment include Exit Cards and short quizzes using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) tools such as "Mentimeter". The department also employs self-assessment rubrics to enable students to evaluate their own understanding and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, educational technology tools such as Padlet are utilised to promote collaborative learning, allowing students to share insights, engage in peer discussions, and collectively build knowledge through interactive digital platforms.</p>
