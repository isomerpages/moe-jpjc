Formative assessments are conducted during the course of instruction by the JPJC Economics Department to monitor students’ learning progress, diagnose learning difficulties and provide feedback on areas that need improvement. The modes of formative assessment include Exit Cards and short quizzes using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) tools such as “Quizziz” and “Mentimeter”.</p>
