Our academic programme equips students with a broad understanding of fundamental economic principles, theories and concepts and the ability to use the tools of economic reasoning to explain, analyse and resolve economic issues and evaluate policy decisions. Students will gain a deeper understanding of economic issues in Singapore, Asia and the world. Students will also acquire skills such as critical thinking, clear communication and thoughtful inquiry that will enable them to be lifelong learners and contributing members of the community.</p>

The JPJC Economics Department uses a variety of teaching and pedagogical approaches as such cooperative learning, concept mapping, blended learning, seminar style teaching and small group consultations. These strategies make the learning of Economics more enjoyable for students.</p>
