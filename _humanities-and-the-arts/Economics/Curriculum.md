Our academic programme equips students with a broad understanding of fundamental economic principles, theories and concepts and the ability to use the tools of economic reasoning to explain, analyse and resolve economic issues and evaluate policy decisions. Students will gain a deeper understanding of economic issues in Singapore, Asia and the world. Students will also acquire skills such as critical thinking, clear communication and thoughtful inquiry that will enable them to be lifelong learners and contributing members of the community.</p>

<p>The JPJC Economics Department adopts a skills based approach in designing the curriculum and focuses on developing thinking skills that are relevant for the job market. The department uses a variety of teaching and pedagogical approaches such as cooperative learning, concept mapping, blended learning and small group consultations. These strategies make the learning of Economics more enjoyable for students.</p>
