The mission of the JPJC Economics Department is to develop confident and self-directed learners who are able to assess the role of economic agents in the allocation of scarce resources and adopt multiple perspectives in understanding real-world economic issues. JPJC Economics students should develop a set of knowledge, skills and values that encourages them to take an active interest in the domestic and global economy as contributing and concerned citizens.
