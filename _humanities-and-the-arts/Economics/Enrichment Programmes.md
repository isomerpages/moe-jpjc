### **Enrichment Programmes**
The JPJC Economics Department also believes that learning of economics goes beyond the classroom. Annually, the department provides opportunities for students to participate in competitions, dialogues and seminars such as:
*   the Enterprise Singapore Business Challenge
*   MOE Economics Seminar
*   Singapore Budget Dialogue with Members of Parliament from Jurong GRC.

Such enrichment activities serve to expose our students to the application of economics in the real world, broaden the appreciation of the subject and raise awareness of current economic issues of interest. This approach of making learning more experiential and hands-on allows our students to deepen their understanding of the subject, which is in line with inculcating joy of learning in our students and motivates them to consider pursuing the study of economics in the future.   Local or overseas learning journeys are also organised to provide students with insights into the future trends and application of economics for businesses and enterprise innovations.
