### **Curriculum and Syllabus**

The curriculum framework for the **H1 and H2 Level Art syllabus** is structured under three behavioural domains of Perceiving, Communicating and Appreciating.

| erceiving | Communicating | Appreciating |
|---|---|---|
| <br>* Students respond to and interpret visual images and objects sensitively and informatively. | <br>* Students express their thoughts, experiences and feelings in visual, tactile, oral or literary forms.<br><br>* Students draw on artistic ideas, organise information, solve problems and express intent and purpose. | <br>* Students value the visual arts as a powerful means of expression. |

At Jurong Pioneer Junior College, we offer both H1 and H2 Art at the ‘A’ levels.<br>
