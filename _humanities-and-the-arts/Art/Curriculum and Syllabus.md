<h4><strong>Study of Visual Arts (SOVA)</strong></h4>
<p>
The <strong>Study of Visual Arts (SOVA)</strong> emphasises the development of visual literacy through critical and creative thinking by encouraging personal responses to art appreciation. <strong>Both H1 and H2 art students</strong> will learn to critically respond to and interpret artworks of a large variety during lessons and learn to write about art.</p>

<p>
The content for the <strong>SOVA</strong> is organised along two broad themes: Visual Arts and Representations and Visual Arts and Society. The theme of Visual Arts and Representations provides a broad framework for the investigation of form and content and touches on ideas and concepts underpinning visual representation. The theme of Visual Arts and Society draws on the diverse realms of human experience to examine Art as a system for the communication of social values, beliefs and opinions.</p>

<h4><strong>Studio Practice</strong></h4>
<p>
<strong>Studio Practice</strong> which is <strong>only available for the H2 students,</strong> engages students in the creation of artworks. Students will acquire skills such as research, experimentation and exploration, idea development, personal reflection and evaluation in the process of creating artworks. Preparatory studies are an integral and important part of the Studio Practice. Through the preparatory studies, students learn to think through issues and problems and develop their abilities to translate ideas into artworks. </p>
