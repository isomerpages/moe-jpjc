The Art unit seeks to nurture a love for the arts in students through delivering an effective art curriculum that develops in them critical thinking and creativity through the process of art making involving the use of a variety of media and technologies. We believe that these aptitudes are essential in the face of the challenges of the knowledge-based and innovation-driven economy.
