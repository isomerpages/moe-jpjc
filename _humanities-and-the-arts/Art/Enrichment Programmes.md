In order to bring the subject of Art to life, our H1 and H2 Art students get the opportunity to participate in a wide range of enrichment opportunities. Here are some of the experiences that students can look forward to.</p>


<h4><strong>1. Museum Based Learning</strong></h4>
<p>
As part of our curriculum, students embark on a&nbsp;<strong>Museum Based Learning</strong>&nbsp;module to the National Gallery Singapore and other museums, specifically focusing on artworks from artists that are in the syllabus. The Museum Based Learning module allows for students to engage with artworks in a multi-sensory manner, making space for deeper, authentic learning to happen.</p>&lt;

<h4><strong>2. Park(ing) Day</strong></h4>
<p>
<strong>PARK(ing) Day</strong>&nbsp;is an annual event jointly organised by SUTD and URA. On this day, people come together to creatively re-imagine regular parking lots as art spaces, injecting vibrancy and fun into the streets. Through this project, the students experience urban design, real-world prototyping, community engagement and creative expression while at the same time learn to appreciate urban culture and sustainability.

<h4><strong>3. ArtLab workshop</strong></h4>
<p>
<strong>JPJC ArtLab</strong>&nbsp;is an annual Art Workshop planned and run by J2 Art students for Secondary School students. During the workshop, JPJC Art students host Secondary School students who may be interested in taking art as an ‘A’ Level Subject and introduce exciting and unusual art-making techniques. ArtLab also serves as a platform for Art students to take up leadership roles and build their portfolio.

<p>
On top of the above enrichment opportunities,&nbsp;the Art Unit also provides opportunities for students to participate in Art-related competitions, exhibitions and workshops. Our unique links to artists in the syllabus, alumni who have gone on to pursue art-related careers and Art-related further education allow students to better appreciate the importance of Art in society and interact with local arts practitioners.

Such valuable opportunities offer students unique insights into the ideas and processes of the artists they study.</figcaption></figure></div>
