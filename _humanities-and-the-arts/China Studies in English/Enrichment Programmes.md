##### **Seminars/Lectures by University lecturers**
To enable our students to be future-ready, we seek to expand our students’ horizon beyond just what they learn in the classroom but also to hear from multiple perspectives. As such, the unit has been working with various Institutes of Higher Learning such as  SMU in organising Seminar Series to deepen CSE students on various subject content. The collaboration also exposes and prepares our students to the learning styles at our local universities. When the opportunity arises, students are also given the chance to attend various forums and lectures such as the annual Ho Rih Hwa Leadership Lecture Series which has featured renowned speakers, such as, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Ban Ki Moon, and Anwar Ibrahim.

##### **Overseas Learning Journeys/Field Trips**
As  students of China Studies, it is important to have the opportunity for on-site learning in China. These specific experiential learning journeys deepens students’ understanding of key content by visiting significant sites that tell about the economic, political, and social development of China. These sites include museums, urban planning exhibition halls, and even political institutes such as the Party Schools. In addition, the trips include attending lectures at the local Chinese universities and half-day immersion experience at the local senior high schools. These are invaluable opportunities for CSE students to increase their understanding of the Chinese worldview.
