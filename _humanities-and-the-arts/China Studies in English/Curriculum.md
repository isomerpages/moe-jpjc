China Studies focuses on the transformation of China since 1978 and its future. One of the key features of the curriculum is the issue-based approach which provides a focus for the discussion of the developments in contemporary China. It supports and offers opportunities for constructivist teaching and learning as the study of issues will provide students with a way to thoughtfully consider how individuals and institutions in a society interact and relate to each other, and give them a meaningful way of using knowledge from relevant sources.</p>

The <strong>H2 CSE syllabus</strong> content is grouped by four key issues - Governing China and its challenges, China’s development and its impact, Chinese society and its transformation, and Rise of China and its implications. The four content dimensions of economy, politics, society and international relations constitute the knowledge domain in China Studies. Even though the study of each key issue is foregrounded by one main content dimension, students will draw from relevant content dimensions and examine the interrelationships between two or more dimensions. Making the connections across relevant dimensions is vital to appreciate the complexity of the challenges and developments facing contemporary China.
