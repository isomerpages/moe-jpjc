### **Syllabus & Assessment**

#### **H2 Level CSE Syllabus**
<p align=justify>
The H2 CSE syllabus content is grouped by four key issues - Governing China and its challenges, China’s development and its impact, Chinese society and its transformation, and Rise of China and its implications. The four content dimensions of economy, politics, society and international relations constitute the knowledge domain in China Studies. Even though the study of each key issue is foregrounded by one main content dimension, students will draw from relevant content dimensions and examine the interrelationships between two or more dimensions. Making the connections across relevant dimensions is vital to appreciate the complexity of the challenges and developments facing contemporary China.

<u>Paper 3: Independent Study Paper</u>
<p align=justify>
The aim of the independent research component in the H2 CSE paper is to provide students with an opportunity to pursue a topic of interest related to any of the four key issues in the syllabus. It is an individual research paper where students will select a research area that has to be submitted to Cambridge for approval before the study is embarked on. Students will be guided by a Coursework Supervisor (a tutor from the college).
