### **China Studies in English**
<p align=justify>
The CSE unit seeks to develop students into confident, globally-savvy individuals who are ‘China-conversant’. We want our students will grow into individuals who practise critical thinking and are keenly aware of global issues and trends through the study of China’s relations with other countries and its growth as a regional and global power.
