The China Studies in English unit seeks to equip students with relevant knowledge on contemporary developments in China, develop their critical thinking and information literacy to understand these developments, and instil in them an awareness of the regional and global implications of China’s rise. The China Studies in English unit also seeks to develop China-conversant citizens who can appreciate Singapore’s interests and perspectives in its engagement with China, contribute in their own capacity to further Singapore-China interactions and harness the dynamic opportunities that China can offer.
