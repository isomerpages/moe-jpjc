	<li><strong>Geographical Investigation</strong>-Â Students will get an opportunity to apply what they have learnt in the classroom through fieldwork. This can include assessing flood risk in a drainage basin, investigating the influence of landuse on infiltration rates or conducting needs analysis of the elderly living in an urban neighbourhood. This enables students to construct understanding through geographical inquiry using data collection and analysis methods.</li>
	<li><strong>Seminars/Talks</strong>- Interested students can choose to sign up to attend talks or seminars conducted by university lecturers on topics such as Globalisation and Climate Change. This can broaden their perspectives on issues relevant to their syllabus.</li>
	<li><strong>
Competitions</strong>- Students with a passion in the subject can sign up to participate in international and national level competitions. This includes the AOGS-EOS where students get the experience of conducting an investigative geoscience project and exhibit and share their findings with others.</li></ol>
