The Geography unit seeks to develop in students an awareness and curiosity of the world around them. We want our students to understand the uniqueness of natural environments and places, the interactions and interdependence between natural environments, societies and cultures, and thereby, enhance studentsâ€™ sense of responsibility to care for the environment and its people.</p>
	
<p>
Most importantly, we also want students to be able to relate what they have learnt in the classroom to the wider context in the real world.
