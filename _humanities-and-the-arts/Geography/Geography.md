<p>
The Geography unit seeks to develop in students an awareness and curiosity of the world around them. Students should understand the uniqueness of natural environments and places, and the interactions and interdependence between natural environments, economies, politics, societies and cultures.</p>

<p>
Through the Geography curriculum, students should develop a sense of responsibility to care for the environment and its people. Students should also be able to relate what they have learnt in the classroom to the wider context, and in the real world.</p>
