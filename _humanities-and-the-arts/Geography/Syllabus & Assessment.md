<h4><strong>H2 Level Geography Syllabus</strong></h4>
<div align=justify>
<p>
The <strong>H2 Geography syllabus</strong> content is grouped by four themes. The four themes are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Theme 1 (Tropical Environments)</strong> helps students to understand the workings of atmospheric, geomorphic and hydrologic processes and associated landforms in the tropical regions through a systems approach. Students learn about feedback loops to analyse humans’ impact on the environment and how humans are in turn affected by environmental hazards.</li>
	
<li><strong>Theme 2 (Development, Economy and Environment)</strong> introduces students to the underlying political and socio-economic structures that determine what kind of natural resources are transformed into different kinds of useful products in different parts of the world. Through case studies, students gain insights into how political and economic decisions influence the society and our environment at various scale.</li>
	
<li><strong>Theme 3 (Sustainable Development)</strong> highlights the importance of exploring how people in different parts of the world are affected when natural environments are exploited. Students confront the contradictions between meeting present needs and achieving intergenerational equity, that is, to pass on the environment in a ‘reasonable condition’ to future generations. Students also explore the tensions between development and environmental sustainability. Students also explore the tensions between development and environmental sustainability.</li>

<li><strong>Theme 4 (Geographical Investigation)</strong> provides students with opportunities to carry out fieldwork locally to apply skills and deepen their understanding of what they have learnt from Themes 1–3. They will learn geographical inquiry processes such as how to craft research questions, plan for their investigations, collect, present and analyse data, evaluate and communicate their findings and apply them to their Geographical Investigation.</li></ul>

<h4><strong>H1 Level Geography Syllabus</strong></h4>

<p>
The <strong>H1 Geography syllabus</strong> content is grouped by three themes. The three themes are as follows:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Theme 1 (Climate Change and Flooding)</strong> helps students to understand the workings of atmospheric and hydrologic processes in the tropical regions through a systems approach. Students use feedback loops to analyse the effect of human activities on the natural environment and how humans are in turn affected by environmental hazards related to climate change such as floods.</li>
	<li><strong>Theme 2 (Urban Change)</strong> examines the environmental impact of cities and the unevenness of socioeconomic development. It explores practical solutions that conserve the environment without denying opportunities to the urban poor. Students will deliberate on the contradictions between achieving intergenerational equity and building liveable urban environments to meet present needs.</li>
	<li><strong>Theme 3 (Geographical Investigation)</strong> provides students with a range of opportunities to carry out fieldwork locally to apply skills and deepen their understanding of what they have learnt from Themes 1 and 2. They will learn geographical inquiry processes such as how to craft research questions, plan for their investigations, collect, present and analyse data, evaluate and communicate their findings to difference audiences and apply them to their Geographical Investigation.</li></ul>

<h4><strong>H1 Level Geography Assessment</strong></h4>
<p>
The examination consists of one paper, with duration of 3 hours.</p>
