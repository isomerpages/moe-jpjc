<p>
Four geographical concepts that reflect how geographers study the world frame the curriculum. These four geographical concepts are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Space</li>
	<li>Place</li>
	<li>Environment and</li>
	<li>Scale</li></ol>

<p>
	Students are expected to gain a sophisticated understanding of these concepts and apply them to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>inquire and describe the world we live in;</li>
	<li>analyse issues, phenomena and human-nature relationships; and</li>
	<li>discuss global efforts to achieve sustainable development.</li></ul>
