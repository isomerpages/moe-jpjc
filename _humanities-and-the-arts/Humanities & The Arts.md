The study of subjects related to the Humanities and the Arts is about the human experience. The knowledge of the human experience helps students connect and make sense of the world and provides them with the tools to imagine the future while appreciating past accomplishments.</p>

Our college offers O level students who are passionate about Geography, History, Politics or Visual Art the chance to enter via the Direct Schools Admission. Students who successfully enter the college via the DSA track will be nurtured under the Talent & Leadership Development Framework. They will be given the opportunity to participate and lead in the various Humanities/Art programmes and competitions that the college is involved in.</p>
