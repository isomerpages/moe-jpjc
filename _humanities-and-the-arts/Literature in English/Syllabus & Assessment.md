<h3><strong>Syllabus Outline</strong></h3>
<div align="justify">
<p>
H1 / H2 Literature in English<br>
Candidates should be capable of commenting on the stylistic and literary features of the texts in their discussion of unseen extracts and texts studied. In other words, the ability to appreciate the text in and of its own right is assessed, alongside the ability to demonstrate knowledge of the literary context. Assessment comes in the form of writing critical essays relevant to the examination questions asked. These involve both a personal informed response through the use of various literary technical devices linked to the overall theme of the literary texts, as well as demonstration of critical understanding and insight into the literary epoch within which the selected texts are drawn from.<br>
H1 candidates will sit for P1.<br>
H2 candidates will sit for P1 and P3.</p>
