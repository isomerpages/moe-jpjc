### **JPJC Alumni**
The merger of Jurong Junior College and Pioneer Junior College has brought together the alumni of both colleges, creating a strong network of support to enrich the college experience for the students of Jurong Pioneer Junior College.

Since 2019, the alumni of both colleges have come together, working in partnership with the college to inspire our students with their stories of undergraduate and career experiences. At the same time, the college also organises homecoming events and creates platforms for alumni to reconnect with their former college mates and teachers.

##### **Reconnect with us**
For JJC and PJC alumni who wish to reconnect with their former college mates and teachers, you can visit the following URLs:

* [https://www.facebook.com/JJAlumni/](https://www.facebook.com/JJAlumni/) (for Jurong JC alumni)  
* [https://www.facebook.com/groups/pioneeralumnicircle/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pioneeralumnicircle/) (for Pioneer JC alumni)

The college will be announcing the formation of JPJC Alumni soon, and will provide updates here on the school website.

##### **Invitation to contribute**
We invite you to come to JPJC to contribute to the school experiences of our current students. There are a great variety of ways. For example:

* **Further Education and Career Guidance:** Providing advice regarding university education and career guidance in terms of providing industry insights, work attachment opportunities, learning journeys to corporations for our students.

* **Volunteering Opportunities:** Creating platforms for our students to organise VIA-related programmes so as to play a part to contribute to the community.

* **Speaker’s Series:** Establishing networks, through sharing of life experiences to motivate our students and providing further education and career guidance.

##### **b. Homecoming Events**
Over the past few years, we have welcomed home many batches of alumni, together with their loved ones for various homecoming events held in both colleges. Many who turned up brought their yearbooks and old photos along, and reconnected with former college mates and teachers, recounting the good old days spent in the college campuses.

The college also takes pride in organising Homecoming Games, a line-up of sports pitting alumni against current students. Each year, approximately 200 alumni and current students bonded through a variety of games such as Touch Rugby, Basketball, Badminton, Floorball, Netball, Ultimate Frisbee and Volleyball.

There was something for everyone as alumni forged strong ties with their juniors and enjoyed a day of reminiscence. It was indeed heartening to receive such a massive show of support for these events from our alumni!
