### **Physical Education Curriculum**
<p align=justify>
The PE Curriculum is designed to cater to a spectrum of abilities and interests.Â  In sports, students will learn both individual and team sports at both in-depth and recreational levels and learn to plan and organise a simple competition. In the Health and Fitness aspect, students learn a range of topics from the principles of training to diet and nutrition.</p>
<p align=justify>
PE serves to complement other educational areas in promoting educational outcomes that are less likely to be achieved in other subject areas.</p>

The manner in which PE activities are taught determines how students will feel about making it a part of their lifestyle. The PE programme for students should be enjoyable to ensure that they develop a positive association with activity.</p>
