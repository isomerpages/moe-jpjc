<p>Physical Education (PE) is an essential part of the school curriculum, promoting the holistic development of students through physical activity, teamwork, and healthy lifestyle practices. By engaging in a variety of sports, exercises, and wellness programs, students not only improve their physical fitness but also develop critical life skills such as discipline, resilience, and collaboration. PE nurtures the mind and body, laying the foundation for lifelong health and well-being, and empowering students to thrive both in and beyond the classroom. </p>
