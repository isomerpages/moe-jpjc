<p>We are pleased to announce that Ms Yvonne Koh Feng Ying, Senior Teacher, has been conferred the Inspiring Teacher of English Award.</p>

<p>This award acknowledges the dedication of English language educators who possess a deep passion for making the English language engaging and applicable to their students. They demonstrate innovation in facilitating effective learning experiences. The award is presented in collaboration with the Speak Good English Movement and The Straits Times, with the support of the Ministry of Education.</p>	
	
<h4><strong>Insights into the Teaching of General Paper: Ms. Koh's Perspective</strong></h4>

<p>“In my General Paper (GP) classroom, I view myself as a fellow explorer with my students. I believe it is crucial for us to jointly reflect on and learn from our experiences in the classroom. Above all, it is vital for me to understand the learning needs of my students through these experiences.</p>

<p>Some students think that GP is a daunting subject. I strive to make it accessible by connecting what we learn in class to real-world experiences, and by incorporating games into my lessons. One example of a game I designed is the "Amazing Race". Students collaborate in groups to take photos of objects around them as part of their response to given questions. When I meet my former students, they show me photos from past races. They tell me that they remember the connections they forged with one another and how they enjoyed their learning together. I am, therefore, reminded of this quote by Carl W. Buehner - ‘They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you made them feel.’</p>

<p>For me, teaching is not just about imparting knowledge. It is about creating lasting memories and turning a subject that might seem daunting to some into an enjoyable and meaningful one.”</p>
