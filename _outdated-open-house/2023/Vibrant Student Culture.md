<h3>Vibrant Student Culture</h3>
<h5>Co-Curriculum Activities</h5>	

<p>CCA is an integral part of every student’s experience in the college. It provides a platform for all students to acquire and demonstrate their skills, as well as develop social and emotional competencies that prepare them to face the challenges of tomorrow. Check out over 30&nbsp;CCAs offered in JPJC <a href="https://www.jpjc.moe.edu.sg/jpjc-experience/co-curriculum/talent-n-leadership-development-programme/co-curricular-activities/">here.</a></p>
