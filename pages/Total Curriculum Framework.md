Guided by our mission to nurture a community of active learners, innovative thinkers and compassionate leaders, with confidence for the future, the JPJC Total Curriculum Framework sets the direction for the implementation of the curriculum and co-curriculum in order to achieve the desired outcomes for our students. The framework identifies six key enablers to be adopted by all staff to help our students meet their goals and aspirations. With the college values as our core and foundation, underpinned by our common beliefs, all staff and students aspire towards our college vision together.<p></p>

	<h5><strong><li>Student Outcomes</li></strong></h5>

<p>
We believe in the potential of our students. To enable all students to discover their interests and talents so that they can develop their knowledge and skills, we offer them a wide array of rich learning opportunities through various engagement platforms.</p>
	
<p>
We seek to inculcate a self-directed learning disposition in our students such that as <strong>active learners</strong>, they possess a drive to learn, unlearn and re-learn throughout life. To achieve personal excellence, they commit to give their best in their pursuits, take initiative to seek continuous improvement and overcome challenges.</p>
	
<p>
We enable our students to be&nbsp;<strong>innovative thinkers</strong>&nbsp;by broadening their thinking and developing their creativity. Critical thinkers with the curiosity for new and different ideas will be able to analyse problems deeply, identify opportunities for growth and create thoughtful and ethical solutions for positive change.</p>
	
<p>
We place a strong emphasis on character and citizenship education with the goal to nurture&nbsp;<strong>compassionate leaders</strong>&nbsp;who demonstrate care and empathy for others and contribute actively to make a meaningful impact to the community.
</p>
	
<p>
We are committed to equipping our students with the relevant knowledge, skills and values so that they have the confidence to gain new knowledge, create sustainable futures and lead purposeful lives.
</p>

<h5><strong><li>Values</li></strong></h5>
<p>
The college believes in the importance of values-driven education to bring about the desired outcomes of education, so as to enable our students to thrive as concerned and active citizens of the nation and the global community.</p>

<p>
We encourage our students to have the&nbsp;<strong>integrity</strong>&nbsp;and moral courage to stand up for what is right. The integrity of every student is essential to building trust and developing constructive relationships with others.</p>
	
<p>
We commit to developing students and leaders who have a strong sense of&nbsp;<strong>responsibility</strong>&nbsp;and duty to self, family and community. They put in their best effort in whatever they do.</p>
	
<p>
We instill the quality of&nbsp;<strong>respect</strong>&nbsp;in our students by developing their positive self-worth while valuing the beliefs and contributions of others.</p>
	
<p>
We strengthen our students’&nbsp;<strong>resilience</strong>&nbsp;to navigate adversity and inculcate the belief that overcoming setbacks enables them to achieve their goals.</p>
	
<p>
We cultivate our students’&nbsp;<strong>compassion</strong>&nbsp;to show care and concern for as well as to be sensitive to the needs of others, so that they reach out to lend a hand to those in need.</p>

<h5><strong><li>Enablers</li></strong></h5>
	<h6><u>E1: Well-Rounded Curriculum</u></h6>
<p>
The college places a strong emphasis on delivering a well-rounded curriculum focused on holistic education and acquisition of the 21st Century Competencies. In the academic area, the different subjects emphasise deep disciplinary thinking and understanding while equipping our students with critical analytical skills to solve complex problems and issues. The college’s academic curriculum also develops a greater breadth of knowledge and understanding of the real-world environment. We place equal emphasis on the co-curriculum to inculcate college values, offering every student opportunities to develop leadership competencies and explore their interests and talents. To enable our students to become active learners prepared for the future, the total curriculum provides rich learning experiences for students to construct and co-construct meaning and apply their learning through authentic tasks within and beyond the classroom.</p>

<h6><u>E2: Learner-Centred Pedagogy</u></h6>
<p>
JPJC teachers are equipped with a wide repertoire of pedagogies which they can deploy to deliver the curriculum and facilitate learning in order to achieve the desired outcomes of learning. Taking a learner-centred approach, teachers respond to individual student needs through the differentiation of content, processes and tasks, according to their aptitude, interests and learning styles. Through deep and engaged learning, students are able to critically analyse and evaluate information, creatively synthesise new knowledge and ideas, as well as express their thoughts and ideas clearly and effectively. By igniting the joy of learning and harnessing the motivation to learn, teachers develop active and self-directed learners who are able to take ownership of their learning. Students will then be able to identify gaps, apply their learning to new contexts, reflect and use feedback to improve their own learning.</p>

<h6><u>E3: Effective and Balanced Assessment</u></h6>
<p>
Assessment is integral in enhancing the learning experience for students. It is a means for students to apply what they have learnt and show evidence of learning. JPJC teachers design purposeful and differentiated assessment tasks with clear objectives and outcomes. We use a range of formative and summative assessments to assess students in both academic and co-curricular areas. Assessment is used to provide meaningful feedback to help students address their gaps and learn more effectively. Teachers analyse information and evidence of learning derived from assessment to improve our teaching practices. In line with the nation’s move towards reducing over-testing and over-emphasis on academic results, we hope to develop students’ capacity for self-assessment through critical reflection. As a tool to motivate students, an effective and balanced assessment helps students gain confidence and become self-directed learners.</p>

<h6><u>E4: Skilful Teachers</u></h6>
<p>
The role of a JPJC teacher is to design and deliver instruction to facilitate active learning. By using a range of learner-centred pedagogies, teachers facilitate deep understanding of concepts in students and equip them with the skills to apply what they have learnt to different contexts and unfamiliar situations. We recognise that students have diverse learning needs and styles which must be met through differentiated instruction. Teachers also develop critical thinking skills in students through inquiry-based learning. Being proficient in assessment literacy, we adopt a wide range of assessment tools to identify learning gaps in students. As reflective educators, we consistently improve our practice collaboratively through learning rounds and professional learning networks. As models of lifelong learning, we empower and encourage teachers to take ownership of their own learning and development. The executive and administrative staff of the college also undergo timely and relevant training to keep themselves up to date with the skills required to effectively support college processes.</p>

<h6><u>E5: Safe and Conducive Environment for Learning</u></h6>
<p>
The college believes that learning can only take place in a safe and conducive environment that provides meaningful physical learning spaces, as well as strong socio-emotional support for all students. The improvement in learning spaces and resources must dovetail curricular and pedagogical innovation in order to maximize positive impact on teaching and learning. The environment we create must make students feel safe, supported and unrestricted, so that they are able to confidently express themselves, initiate ideas, while learning to listen and value others’ perspectives. It is important to build strong teacher-student relationships based on trust, so that teachers are able to identify the learning needs of their students and implement the appropriate teaching strategies for them. This strengthens the emotional well-being of students and develop a positive learning environment that promotes respect for the diversity of views and personalities around them. Meanwhile, emergency preparedness, school security and safety are also top priority areas to ensure a safe college for all staff and students. The executive and administrative staff also play a critical role in providing effective and efficient support to enable all college programmes to be carried out smoothly, thereby contributing significantly to creating an ideal learning environment.</p>

<h6><u>E6: Meaningful Partnerships</u></h6>
<p>
The college seeks to establish impactful and sustainable partnerships with stakeholders to provide a wide range of meaningful learning opportunities for our students. Working closely with parents, alumni, education institutions and community partners, teachers co-create and develop authentic learning experiences for students within and outside the classroom. Adopting an experiential learning model, students are actively engaged in the learning activities and then they reflect on their experiences to gain key learning points and insights. These partnerships also provide an avenue for students to contribute and give back to the community in ways that benefit the needs of the community. Through such meaningful active learning experiences, we want students to think beyond self, develop empathy and make a positive impact in the community.</p>

<h5><strong><li>Fundamental Beliefs</li></strong></h5>
<p>
A set of fundamental core beliefs provides the foundation for the college to achieve its VMV and for staff to be cognisant of principles that underlie their approaches to guide and develop students in both academic and co-curricular areas. These beliefs are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Every student is&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>&nbsp;and has&nbsp;<strong>limitless capacity for growth</strong>.</li>
	<li>Teachers ignite&nbsp;<strong>joy of learning</strong>, cultivate&nbsp;<strong>motivation for learning</strong>&nbsp;and help students achieve&nbsp;<strong>personal excellence</strong>.</li>
	<li>College staff show&nbsp;<strong>care and concern</strong>&nbsp;for the well-being and holistic development of students.</li></ol></ol></ol></div>
