<p>JPJC develops studentsâ€™ self-regulation skills to encourage greater awareness and ownership of their own growth, in pursuit of short-term and long-term goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The JPJC Self-Regulation Framework comprises three aspects: (i) daily routines (ii) self-care and (iii) learning habits.
</p>

<p><strong>Daily routines:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>What is the daily routine that I have to put in place to achieve my short-term and long-term goals?</li>
	<li>How can I plan, and allocate time realistically, for my academic studies, CCA, family and other interests?</li>
	<li>How can I ensure that I commit effectively to this plan?</li></ul>
	
	
<p><strong>Learning habits:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>What are the good learning habits that I have to put in place to achieve my short-term and long-term goals?</li>
	<li>Do I know effective subject-specific study skills?</li></ul>
	
<p><strong>Self-care:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>How can I take care of myself?</li>
	<ul>
		<li>What are my physical, intellectual, emotional &amp; social needs?</li>
		<li>What do I need to pay more attention to?</li>
		<li>How can I get myself to be more mindful?</li></ul></ul></ol></div>
