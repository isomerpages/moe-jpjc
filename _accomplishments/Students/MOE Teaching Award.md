<h5><strong>Sim En Qi (18A03)</strong></h5>
<p>
With her keen interest in Chinese culture and a strong passion for literary arts, En Qi has always been excited to explore the rich world of Chinese Language and Literature. This was one of the GCE ‘A’ Level subjects she offered during her two-year course in the Arts Faculty as a student of JPJC. Her love for the language led her to pursue her dream of being an educator, and her passion and enthusiasm culminated in her being conferred the MOE Teaching Award.  En Qi will be pursuing a Bachelor of Arts (Education) – Chinese Language degree at NTU-NIE.</p>

<h6><i><strong>How has JPJC supported you in your ‘A’ Level journey?</strong></i></h6>
<p>
“When I was studying for the ‘A’ Level exams, I was under a lot of stress and pressure to do well. My teachers have been a great pillar of support through this tough ride, helping me cope with difficult situations especially during the examination period. In particular, my Mother Tongue Language and Literature teachers have been very encouraging. They always supported and motivated me when I attended competitions and applied for internships or scholarships. As I look back on my school experience, I am grateful to be a student of JPJC. Although the journey had been tough at times, it has made me grow into a more forward-looking and mature individual. All these experiences have made me a more confident and resilient person when facing adversities.”</p>

<h6><i><strong>Do you have any words of advice for your juniors?</strong></i></h6>
<p>
“An improvement in results can be earned through hard work. It is really important to have a goal in mind, be it a dream career or an ambition. Make it a daily habit to do your best every day!  I do not consider myself to be smart, but I do believe that hard work is integral to success, so press on!”</p>

<h4><strong>Nur Diyanah Binte Mohammed Dali (18A09)</strong></h4>
<p>
To be an educator and share her passion in Malay Language and Literature with others has always been a lifelong aspiration for Diyanah. So she was extremely honoured and overjoyed when she learnt that she had successfully received the MOE Teaching Award to pursue a Bachelor of Arts (Education) degree at NTU-NIE. Apart from being a committed Student Councillor in her two years at JPJC, Diyanah was actively involved in the Malay Language Elective Programme – a niche programme of the college, and immersed herself in a wide range of Malay cultural and literary activities. The extensive experience has allowed her to grow into an even more confident individual who is passionate about pursuing her dreams and achieving success.</p>

<h6><i><strong>How has JPJC supported you in your A Level journey?</strong></i></h6>
<p>
“I have to attribute this achievement to those who have been my pillars of support throughout my educational journey - my family, my friends and of course, JPJC. In college, I have made long-lasting friendships which I will always cherish and I have met dedicated teachers whom I will never forget. My teachers consistently made sure that I was doing well in school, giving countless consultations and always making time to give me advice and socio-emotional support. As we are no strangers to storms in our lives, I am deeply grateful for my teachers and even the non-teaching staff who motivated me to soldier on during trying periods. They have proven that small acts of kindness, like a smile and simple reassurances, can go a very long way. It is no doubt that my JPJC experience was a significant and unforgettable one.”<p>

<h6><i><strong>Do you have any words of advice for your juniors?</strong></i></h6>
<p>
“My dear juniors, when the going gets tough, I hope you will remind yourselves that the potential that you have is much greater than the obstacles you are facing. Don’t be afraid to ask for the help you need and remember to take good care of your health! I wish you success for your ‘A’ Level examinations and for your future.”</p>

<figcaption><strong>The range of unforgettable and enjoyable experiences Nurul’ain had received through the Malay Language Elective Programme cemented her resolve to become a Malay Language educator, and apply for the MOE Teaching Award – which she successfully received.

<h5><strong>Nurul’ain Bte Nazrin (18A09)</strong></h5>
<p>
As an eloquent and confident young lady with a keen passion for Malay culture, heritage and literary arts, Nurul’ain was very involved in the college’s niche Malay Language Elective Programme. She participated actively in external forums and learning journeys that allowed her to engage in rich conversations about culture and the arts with distinguished speakers, as well as other youth, and performed with the college’s Malay Cultural Society at a variety of events. This range of unforgettable and enjoyable experiences cemented Nurul’ain’s resolve to become a Malay Language educator, and apply for the MOE Teaching Award – which she successfully received, with great joy. Nurul’ain will be pursuing a Bachelor of Arts (Education) - Malay Language degree at NTU-NIE.</p>

<h6><i><strong>How has JPJC supported you in your A Level journey?</strong></i></h6>
<p>
“JPJC has certainly supported me, especially during the period leading up to the ‘A’ Level examinations. I found the Night Study Programme to be extremely useful in particular, because of how it was structured such that we had teachers around who were more than willing to help us. Not only that - most teachers would actually free up their time just for their students to allow them to seek post-lesson consultations. These consultations were what I found most useful, as they gave me the time and opportunity to ask questions regarding lessons and review extra work I completed, which helps me to identify the areas I was weaker at. This preparation helped in building my confidence for the examinations.”</p>

<h6><i><strong>Do you have any words of advice for your juniors?</strong></i></h6>
<p>
“Never give up. As cliche as it sounds, it is true. The A Level examination can be very very unexpected. The results you get can also be something very unexpected. So just try your best and always have close rapport with your teachers. They will be the ones who will help you alongside your family. But that being said, don't be too absorbed in chasing grades too. Spend time with your family and friends too. Be sure of the courses you want to pursue, and find out the entry requirements. All the best!”</p>

Congratulations to all our MOE Teaching Awardees! We wish you all the best in your future endeavours!</p>
