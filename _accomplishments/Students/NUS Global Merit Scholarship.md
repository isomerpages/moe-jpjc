<p>
We are pleased to announce that Calista Wong Shi Ting of 18A07, a Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) alumnus, has been awarded the National University of Singapore (NUS) Global Merit Scholarship 2020. This NUS Scholarship is awarded to high-calibre individuals who demonstrate academic excellence, present excellent co-curricular activities records and exhibit outstanding leadership qualities. NUS Scholars are expected to contribute significantly to the NUS community while in NUS, and emerge as dynamic global leaders who are capable of effecting a positive change to society after they graduate.</p>

<p>
The following is Calista’s profile as well as some interesting snippets of information she has shared with us about her ‘A’ Level journey, and some words of advice for her juniors.</p>

<p>
As the President of The Ambassadors in JPJC, Calista led her team in hosting and engaging with distinguished guests for all major events within and beyond the college. Her zeal to lead by example and serve the college and the wider community was clear in her two years in the college. Calista’s strong interest in global affairs and the humanities also allowed her to engage in meaningful dialogue and discussion with many distinguished guests from academia. The enriching experiences Calista had in JPJC, and her keen conviction to making a difference to society saw her applying for, and successfully being awarded the NUS Global Merit Scholarship. Calista will major in History with a Minor in Global Studies at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at NUS.</p>

<h5><strong>How has JPJC supported you in your A Level journey?</strong></h5>
<p>
“JPJC had given me a conducive environment to study in, be it resources or people. The teachers are really committed to helping their students in the best ways they can, and are always willing to make time for consultations. They're also very invested in the welfare of the students, acting as pillars of support for us in times of need. The non-teaching staff also contribute greatly to making JPJC comfortable for us, ensuring that the place is clean and that food is available even if we decide to stay late in school to study.”</p>

<h5><strong>Do you have any words of advice for your juniors?</strong></h5>
<p>
“Don't be afraid to reach out to the people around you if you need any help! Your teachers and friends are there for you and this journey towards the ‘A’ Level~s~ will be made so much more enjoyable if you all do it together. My main source of support in school has been my class, 18A07 and I think it’s important to find a solid group of people you can rely on, be it your family, classmates or CCA\- mates! Learn to make time for your interests (e.g. VIA, hobbies, competitions) to avoid experiencing any burnout and to help you feel energized!”</p>

Congratulations on your scholarship award, Calista! We wish you all the best in your future endeavours!</p>
