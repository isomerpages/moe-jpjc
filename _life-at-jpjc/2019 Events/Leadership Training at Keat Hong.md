### **Leadership Training Camp @ Keat Hong**
On 6 and 7 June this year, JPJC students in the Scholars Development Programme carried out the annual Leadership Training Camp @ Keat Hong for students from 7 secondary schools in the West Zone. They planned and facilitated the camp activities with the aim of imparting leadership skills to these secondary school students and to provide a safe and enriching platform for youth with different backgrounds to come and learn together, with the help of student mentors from JPJC.

The Guest of Honour was Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Minister of State for National Development and Manpower. Mr Zaqy, who is also a Member of Parliament for Chua Chu Kang GRC, gave the opening address and presented Certificates of Appreciation to participating schools. He also mingled with teachers, camp facilitators and campers.

On the first day of the camp, the campers participated in Station Games which exposed them to various leadership competencies. During the ‘Battle Armour’ activity, they conceptualised and actualised their vision of a warrior by designing a wearable battle armour, using recyclable materials. They also attended an ICT Workshop conducted by the JPJC Infocomm Club and supported by the JPJC ICT Department. The aim of the workshop was to expose the campers to simple coding.

The campers participated in the Amazing Race on the second day, which provided them with a platform to develop their leadership competencies to the fullest. This was followed by the Leaders’ Quiz which tested campers on their knowledge of known Singapore warriors such as the Samsui Women. The final activity was Einstein’s Cradle, which provided the campers with the opportunity to create simple interactive science experiments. This was also a platform for the campers to build their communication skills and confidence, by communicating with younger children and generating interest in science in them. With a heart to serve, our student leaders have indeed ventured beyond the college to contribute to the larger community!
