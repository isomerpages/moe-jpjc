Jurong Pioneer Junior College organised its inaugural JPJC Mathematics and Science Challenge 2019 on 13th July 2019. As STEM is one of the college's key programmes, this competition was specially organised for students from various secondary schools. A total of 84 students from 12 different secondary schools participated. They were pitted against one another in the areas of Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology and Physics through various experiments.</p>

<p>
This Challenge provided a deep learning experience for participants in the areas of Mathematics and Science through gamification. This approach is especially important as it not just focuses on academics but it also helps students to develop skills such as problem solving, communication and collaborative skills which are important for the 21st century.</p>

<p>
The theme for the Challenge 2019 was _The Great Escape_ which also highlighted various environmental issues. This gave students an opportunity to reflect and respond to environmental issues as an informed and responsible citizen, showing more care for Singapore and her environment.</p>

<p>
The event was very well-received with most of student participants commenting that the Challenge had deepened their learning in the area of Mathematics and Science and they derived the joy of learning through overcoming the tasks. This Challenge indeed allowed us to live up to our mission to <i>nurture a community of active learners, innovative thinkers and compassionate leaders.</i>
