Amidst intense competition, the inaugural JPJC WSC (World Scholars’ Cup) squad of 2019 achieved excellent results. The squad had to step up their efforts as the global round was far more challenging than the regional rounds. Coming up against 1,500 scholars from 39 countries, the squad performed admirably, drawing compliments from their opponents, as well as clinching many team and individual honours. Out of 500 teams, the highest ranked team came in 20th place.</p>

Accompanying the students on the trip were the teacher-coaches, Miss Megan Miao, Ms Tan Su Lynn and Mdm Hedzlyn Helyaty. Various members of the college alumni, Ahmad Asyraf, Lianne Sng, Sim Jun You and Law Jia Qi also went along to provide suitable tips and to keep the morale of the squad high. Teacher-coach Mr John Yeo and alumni Annabel Kwek had also supported the squad in training prior to the trip. Their invaluable experience was crucial in preparing the squad for knowing what to expect and how to maximise their performance in each aspect of the competition.</p>

All teams finished in the top 30% of the competition. James Tan from 18A08 emerged as the top scholar from the squad, clinching gold medals for individual debates, writing and challenge. The squad applied what they had learnt from long and rigorous hours of training to stretch their abilities and do the college proud.</p>

After qualifying from the regional round, the global round of the competition provided an opportunity for the squad to deepen their knowledge of the 6 set subject areas – Science, Literature, Arts and Music, History, Social Studies and Special Area (Unsolved Mysteries). They had to answer short questions related to these topics in the Challenge and Bowl categories. To facilitate deeper understanding of these topics, students had to participate in debates with other scholars, applying their knowledge to issues reflecting the contemporary world.</p>

Lastly, they had to participate in a writing challenge, answering a question from one of the subject areas by approaching it either as a conventional argumentative essay or from a more creative angle. The squad honed their insight of these topics in the training sessions before the competition and this showed through their commendable results achieved at the Global Round. Apart from participating in the challenges and bowls, the squad also got to meet scholars from other countries at the Global Scholars’ Ball and participated in cultural activities such as dumpling making. JPJC’s Top Scholar, James Tan (18A08) also performed at the WSC Global Rounds Talent Show!</p>
