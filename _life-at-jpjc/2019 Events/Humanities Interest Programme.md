The Humanities trip to Taipei organised by the Humanities Interest Programme took place from 25th November to 30th November 2019. A total of 20 humanities students and two teachers went on the trip.</p>

<p>
The objectives of this Humanities trip were to get students to develop an awareness of regional trends, develop socio-cultural sensitivities through interaction with Taiwanese students and understand Singapore’s relation to the world. Moreover, as a combined Humanities trip, this journey allowed students to explore global trends using multi-disciplinary lenses as they visited historical, cultural, and geological sites.</p>

<p>
Some highlights of the trip include the half-day school immersion programme at Tatung Municipal High school, attending lectures at Takming University of Science and Technology, and the visit to Yangmingshan National Park and the Yehliu Geopark.</p>

<p>
Our JPJC students thoroughly enjoyed their half-day programme at Tatung Municipal High School as they attended lessons with their Taiwanese friends and were hosted at a local lunch. The interaction allowed our students to learn more about the local education system and the similarities that both Singaporean and Taiwanese students share. The lectures at the university deepened the students’ appreciation of Taiwanese historical and economic development, and how it impacts regional developments. At Yangmingshan and Yehliu GeoPark, the students not only experienced first-hand the forces of nature as they observe coastal and volcanic processes, but also studied the function of tourist sites to the formation of cultural identities from a sociological perspective.</p>
