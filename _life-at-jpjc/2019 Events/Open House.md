### **Open House**
Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) held its annual Open House and opened her doors to potential students and their parents on 15 January 2019 (Tuesday). Our student ambassadors were full of smiles and energetic, ready to receive their potential juniors to give them an authentic college experience through their guided tours. Through the Academic and Subject Combination showcases held in the library, potential students were able to find out more about the JC curriculum, syllabuses and assessment formats. Teachers who were stationed at these booths provided invaluable advice to potential students, helping them make informed choices. JPJC Principal’s talk, helmed by Dr Hang Kim Hoo, allowed audiences to have greater understanding of the JPJC experience. He also shared about the varied opportunities provided for students to enrich their college experiences and develop themselves holistically. MOE personnel were also invited to give a talk about the Chinese and Malay Language Elective Programmes. To heighten the entire atmosphere, various performing arts CCAs put up entertaining performances to showcase our students’ talent. In addition, the CCA showcase which displayed various CCA’s past achievements and activities allowed potential students to have a glimpse of co-curricular life in JPJC. Overall, the Open House was a huge success signifying a great start to JPJC, exemplifying the cohesive spirit and camaraderie of staff and students!
