On 29 March 2019, the Partnership Committee successfully organised the Parents’ Support Group (PSG) Get-To-Know session. The primary objective of this session was to bond with new parents and inform them about PSG activities and how they could be actively involved. This hospitable session served as a platform to welcome parents.</p>

<p>
The session started with the Principal, Dr Hang, addressing the parents. He stressed on the importance of a sustained and strong relationship between the school and parents, as well as the role of parents in shaping the school to be holistic and conducive for students. After the address, parents had the opportunity to interact with current members of the PSG, School Leaders and key personnel.</p>

<p>
Current members of the PSG shared earnestly about their time in PSG, including all the activities that they have organised specially for the students, such as the Night Study Programme, creating work shadowing opportunities and bonding sessions with parents. They shared how students have benefitted well from all these activities, both in the academic and non-academic domains. These activities by the PSG have also benefitted the parents who found joy in spending quality time to bond with their children.</p>

<p>
It is through this Get-To-Know session that PSG members find suitable and potential successors to continue to serve the school and aid the student population, so that the legacy is passed on. Indeed, with the continued collaboration of both parents and the school, students will have a solid support system they need to conquer what lies ahead of them in their educational life here in JPJC.</p>
