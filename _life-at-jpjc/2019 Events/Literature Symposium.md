The English Literature Unit hosted JPJC’s first Literature Symposium on Wednesday, 7 August 2019. This event is a key component of our Instructional Programme to help students consolidate their learning. This is also the only platform where both levels come together in a collaborative venture.</p>

<p>
The theme of this year's event was <i>The Tormented Soul.</i> The event was graced by Mr Vadiveloo Anandaratnam, Senior Curriculum Specialist from CPDD (English Language & Literature Branch), who also addressed the students on strategies for Literature exam candidate. The event included paper presentations and performances of key extracts from some of the core texts studied in class such as <i>Hamlet, Frankenstein,</i> and <i>St Joan</i>. However, the highlight of the Symposium was the ‘hot-seating’ segment. Here, the tutors took on the various roles of playwright, novelist, and poet in accordance with the texts studied. They offered insights into the context and background that underpinned the writer’s intention for each of their craft. This segment was rather well-received by the students.</p>

<p>
The event was largely planned and organised by the students with supervision and guidance by their tutors. The event was a resounding success which was very much evident from the post-event survey for students where most of them indicated that the Symposium was both enriching and meaningful.</p>

<p>
All in all, the Literature Symposium proved to be a wonderful platform that showcased the students’ ability to organise, plan and perform which is very much aligned to the college’s mission of nurturing active learners and innovative thinkers.</p>
