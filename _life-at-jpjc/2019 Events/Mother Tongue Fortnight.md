The competitions were open to all JC1 H1ML and H2MLL students. The Creative Writing Competition sought to uncover literary talents among students and encourage them to deepen their understanding on Malay language and literature, and appreciate Malay poems.  Three students were awarded prizes for the Creative Writing Competition. Meanwhile, a Pulut Kuning Cake Decoration Competition was also organised to encourage students to understand Malay gastronomy - the Pulut Kuning, which is a traditional dish which has significant function in Malay community. The top three winners of the competition were awarded vouchers for their creativity and effort.

The Tamil Language (TL) Unit organised a series of events as part of the Mother Tongue Fortnight activities to introduce to students the forgotten rich heritage, the cultural and traditional experiences of their ancient eating habits. All J1H1 students were involved in the programme. Besides presenting Powerpoint slides, students were introduced to the varying Indian herbs where they viewed, smelt and felt the different samples displayed. They were also given a quiz to test their understanding of the different herbs. A sample of banana leaf with dishes that include different tastes were also displayed. Through this programme, students did appreciate the experience of the ancient eating habit on banana leaves and the use of herbs in Indian food preparation and thus would be able to share this knowledge with their families and siblings. An essay and poetry writing competition was also held as part of the Mother Tongue Fortnight activities.</p>
