The college held its first Annual Road Run 2019 on 8 March. The Principal, Dr Hang Kim Hoo, flagged off the event which started with the Competitive Category (JC1/JC2 Boys), followed by the Competitive Category (JC1/JC2 Girls) and the Staff Race. The students lined the finishing lane to show their support for the competitive runners who were representing their respective Houses. They cheered enthusiastically for the runners as they made their final dash for glory. It was a heart-warming atmosphere where peers were supporting each other and students were supporting their teachers.</p>

<p>
The whole college came together to support the event with all runners trying their best to score points for their Houses. All students had the opportunity to participate in either the competitive Category or the Fun Run. There was also voluntary participation by staff and students to take on roles as student helpers and staff marshals, ensuring the safety of everyone. The event truly exemplified the cohesive spirit of Jurong Pioneer JC. While Owens House emerged as the Champion House, the supporters of the respective Houses rejoiced and celebrated the victory of their runner.</p>
