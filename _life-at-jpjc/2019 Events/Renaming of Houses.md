The new house names were unveiled during morning assembly via a 2-part series video put together by the House Captains. The names ‘Taurus, Aries, Ursa, Pavo, Aquila and Volans’ aligned with the theme ‘Constellations’ highlighting the infinite possibilities, love and growth that the college aspires towards. Besides the unveiling of the new houses, the videos showcased the heritage of the Houses from both PJC and JJC, leading on to the new College values of JPJC as well as the values embodied by each chosen Constellation.</p>

The process for the renaming of the Houses for JPJC began with the House Masters and House Captains brainstorming for possible themes. After a few suitable themes were decided on, the House Masters proceeded to conduct an engagement session with the students in their respective Houses to elicit possible names for each of the selected themes. The purpose of the engagement session was two-fold; firstly to find out what type of names resound with the students, as well as to allow the student population to understand the various criteria in selecting appropriate names and appreciate the thought process through the generation of the final names.</p>
