A translation workshop was organised for the first time for Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) students in Singapore on 17 April, to expose them to translation in the broadcasting context. Facilitated by Mediacorp journalists, our MLEP students were exposed to the techniques of translating. They participated in exciting and interactive activities, in an authentic setting during the 4-hour workshop. This workshop is one of the many activities that our MLEP students get to experience in their 2 years in JPJC.</p>

<p>
MLEP is a two-year programme which prepares students for the GCE ‘A’ Level H2 Malay Language and Literature with the option to offer H3 Malay. Aimed at producing Malay scholars who are ‘Advocates of Humanitarian Values’ (Penggerak Nilai Kemanusiaan), this translation workshop provided them with the basic skills to become effective interlocutors who can navigate between languages proficiently, promoting greater understanding between cultures.</p>

At the workshop, our student Nur Diyanah of 18A09 got a chance to be interviewed by Berita Mediacorp and was featured on their social media website and the 8pm news.</p>
