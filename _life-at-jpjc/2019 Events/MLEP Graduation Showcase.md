On 27th April 2019, the MLEP Graduation Showcase was held to mark the end of the MLEP programme journey for the MLEP students. The Guest of Honour was Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, MP for Jurong GRC and Chairman for the Malay Language Month. The MLEP Graduation Showcase performance “Mari Kita…Siapa Kita?” explores the issue of identity and self. Through this event, our students seek to showcase their learning experiences and encourage the audience to appreciate the Malay language and culture. Also, aligned to the theme of history, the MLEP alumni was invited to do the finale item together with the graduands, entitled ‘Memori Tercipta’ (Creating Memories). At the end of the Showcase, a graduation ceremony was held where our students received their certificates of participation in the MLEP from the Guest of Honour.</p>
