The Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) Chinese New Year (CNY) Celebration was held on 4 February 2019 with a very apt theme – A New Beginning.  As the new batch of JC1s and JC2s gathered in the hall for the CNY performance, the Chinese Orchestra performed two euphonious pieces. Dr Hang Kim Hoo, the principal of JPJC, lifted everyone’s spirits with his engaging opening address. The highlight was the video of each department staff acting out the Dos and the Don’ts of CNY in a humorous way, which brought the greatest laughter to the entire celebration.</p>

A famous magician, Danny Khoo, was also invited to perform, entertaining the entire college with a very intriguing LED light and magic show. Students from the Malay Language Elective Programme put on an eye-opening show with a Dikir Barat performance while our Guitar Ensemble came together and performed ‘Castle in the Sky’, serenading the entire hall with uplifting performances by our very own students. Following that, the JP Dance club captivated the crowd with their spectacular performance, energising the atmosphere further. Five students from class 18S22 came together to perform a medley of three different songs, ‘Beauty and The Beast’, ‘A Million Dreams’ and a well-known song, ‘Despacito’. Their initiative to come together to perform for the college signified the cohesive spirit within our classes. Siddhida Shannigrahi from 18S04 also performed a Chinese pop song named ‘A Little Happiness’, a wonderful testament to racial harmony in our community. Besides students, our teachers joined in to perform too, ending the celebration with a bang with a solo song ‘Spring is back to Earth’ performed by Ms Valerie Tan and a widely known song ‘Gongxi Gongxi’ by teachers from various departments. A truly meaningful Chinese New Year celebration to bring the JPJC family together!</p>
