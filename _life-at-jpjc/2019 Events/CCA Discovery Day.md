### **CCA Discovery Day**
During Enrichment Week, JC2 students from all CCAs took part in the CCA Discovery Day on 7 February 2019. The CCA Discovery Day served as a platform to provide opportunities for students to hone their leadership skills and learn from others through fun and experiential activities. Students signed up to experience CCA activities conducted by student facilitators over two sessions.

For Sports and Games, practice drills on sports-specific fundamental skills and techniques as well as small-sided modified games were conducted.

For Arts and Aesthetics, students got to try out various musical instruments, learned to play simple pieces, and appreciated dance as an art form through experiencing what it was like to be a dancer off stage. The cultural societies also offered Chinese tea appreciation, Bunga Mangga making, and Rangoli art, to name a few.

Passion and Interest CCA covered a wide array of activities, such as terrarium making, first-aid and CPR life-saving skills, Python programming, finger painting, etc.

The slew of activities maximised the exposure of our students to the other CCAs they typically would not choose to join or get to experience. This helped to develop an open mindset to understanding and appreciating areas beyond what they are comfortable in. A great chance for them to all develop the growth mindset!
