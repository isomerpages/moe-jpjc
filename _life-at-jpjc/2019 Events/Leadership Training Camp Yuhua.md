### **Leadership Training Camp @ Yuhua**
Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) organised the annual Leadership Training Camp @ Yuhua on 10 and 11 June for students from secondary schools in the West Zone.

JPJC students in the Scholars Development Programme, mentored by their teachers, planned and facilitated the camp activities. The aim was to impart leadership skills to secondary school students and to provide a safe and enriching platform for youths with different backgrounds to come and learn together, with the help of student mentors from JPJC.

In addition, as this was Singapore’s Bicentennial year, Ms Fu was presented with a bottle that contained 200 well-wishes for Singapore, penned by teachers, camp facilitators and campers during the camp itself. This penning of well wishes took place on the first day after the participants had taken part in a quiz on the history of Singapore.

The LTC at Yuhua was indeed a good opportunity for our students to learn essential planning skills in organising an event or camp. Overall, it was deeply meaningful experience which enabled the participants from the various secondary school in the West Zone and their mentors to bond and learn together.
