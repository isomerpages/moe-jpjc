### **Leadership Training Camp @ Yuhua**

JPJC students in the Scholars Development Programme, mentored by their teachers, planned and facilitated the camp activities. The aim was to impart leadership skills to secondary school students and to provide a safe and enriching platform for youths with different backgrounds to come and learn together, with the help of student mentors from JPJC.
