Amidst fierce competition, the inaugural JPJC WSC (World Scholars’ Cup) Squad of 2019 achieved commendable results. Despite the fact that the 2019 Regional Round in Singapore was the largest ever with nearly 200 Senior Division Scholars, the squad that the college sent did extremely well, with all four teams qualifying for the Global Round in Beijing. The squad exemplified the college’s motto of lifelong learning and trying their best to go further and beyond their potential and abilities.</p>

<p>
The coaching team consisted of Miss Megan Miao, Ms Tan Su Lynn, Mdm Hedzlyn Helyaty and Mr John Yeo, ably assisted by various members of the college alumni led by Ahmad Asyraf, Lianne Sng and Phua Xuan Yun. They assisted in training by judging debate training sessions, setting questions for practice rounds, familiarising the students with the competition format and constantly providing key advice and motivation for the squad.</p>

<p>
This competition provided an opportunity for the squad to explore 6 topics: Science, Literature, Arts and Music, History, Social Studies and Special Area (Unsolved Mysteries) in great detail. They then had to apply these knowledge through debates, collaborative writing, challenge and bowl. The competition involves critical evaluation as the squad had to argue for and against controversial debate motions. Additionally, the competition also tested the creative abilities of the students as the collaborative writing segment included creative prompts. The squad demonstrated their excellent grasp of the topics as they achieved excellent results in all the various categories of the competition.</p>
