The student organising committee of the inaugural JP spotlight was formed in February 2019. A unique concept to involve students who volunteered to be part of the planning committee for actual college events, it was a very good opportunity for our students to explore new areas, be creative and gain new skills. Comprising 12 students, the committee planned and orchestrated the event from its infancy to the final night on 29 March 2019.</p>

<p>
Throughout the whole journey, the committee, led by Mr Oh Keng Yong and Ms Isabelle Tan, learnt many valuable soft skills such as teamwork, leadership and communication. They gleaned hard skills such as event management and stage management as well. Furthermore, the different sub-committees were able to learn many other practical skills from their respective roles: emcee management, liaison work, publicity and logistics.</p>

<p>
The JP Spotlight timeline comprised auditions and the finals which was held in the school hall. The contestants received overwhelming support from their fans and supporters in the auditions and during the finals. Many came down to cheer on their friends and the event culminated after a lengthy discussion by the judges as well as voting from the audience. Three performers were crowned victors of the inaugural JP Spotlight. Lim En Cheng from 19S24 came in 1st place and walked away with the Audience Choice award as well! He thoroughly impressed the audience with a dynamic violin performance. In 2nd place was Sarah Mae Li from 19S04 who performed a powerful rendition of Demi Lovato’s ‘Tell Me You Love Me’ and in 3rd place, James Tan from 18A08 who sang a touching medley of ‘Home’ and ‘Somewhere Out There’.</p>

<p>
This event was a valuable platform for students to showcase their talents. The student organising committee was also a great opportunity for our students to contribute to the college. ‘Light up the stage, let your talents shine’ - the event’s motto aptly describes the entirety of The JP Spotlight experience!</p>
