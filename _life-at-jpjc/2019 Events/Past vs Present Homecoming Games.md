The Past vs Present (PVP) Homecoming Games 2019 was the first event since the merger for JPJC alumni, hosting graduates from Jurong Junior College and Pioneer Junior College. During the event, more than 230 participants were engaged in all-time favourites like badminton, floorball, netball, street soccer, touch rugby, and volleyball.</p>

It was heart-warming to see alumni happily catching up their former teachers and Principals even years after graduation. In between games, participants sneaked in quick photo opportunities with one another, freezing moments of laughter and reminiscence into frames.</p>

Apart from catching up with former classmates, alumni also had the opportunity to play against current JPJC students – as the name of the event suggests. This fun-filled day was launched with a welcome speech by our Principal, Dr Hang, and ended with a sumptuous lunch for all.</p>
