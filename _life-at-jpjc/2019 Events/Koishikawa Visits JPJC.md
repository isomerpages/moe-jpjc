### **Koishikawa Visits JPJC**
Jurong Pioneer Junior College hosted the prestigious Tokyo Metropolitan Koishikawa Secondary Education School for the fourth consecutive year on 13 February 2019. 19 JC2 students from The Ambassadors played host to their Japanese counterparts and through the school exchange, they had the opportunity to engage in intellectually stimulating group discussions with the students from Koishikawa and learnt to appreciate the Japanese culture.

Our students were impressed with the Mathematics and Science projects undertaken by the Koishikawa students, evident in their lively engagement with the presenters at the latter’s project poster presentation segment. Students from both schools were also engaged in the discussion of current affairs – the use of Artificial Intelligence in our daily lives, as well as opening up of the country to foreign workers in response to an ageing population, – pertinent to both countries.

Lunch at our college canteen was a refreshing cultural experience for our Koishikawa guests since lunch in school back home was eating from a bento in a classroom. The variety of food available further impressed upon our Japanese guests the multi-cultural makeup of our society.

Following lunch was a visit to the Lifelong Learning Institute (LLI). The visit served as a practical extension to their topical discussions earlier, where they learnt how the government helped to prepare our people for an unknown job future, through a visit to the Lifelong Learning Exploration Centre at the Institute. Students from both schools also attended a highly engaging workshop “The Hot Seat”, which equipped them with useful interview skills.  Overall, students and teachers from both colleges had a meaningful and fulfilling exchange.
