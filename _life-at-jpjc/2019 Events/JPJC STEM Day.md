True to the spirit of providing opportunities for students to discover their strengths and interest areas in maximising their potential, Jurong Pioneer Junior College held its inaugural Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Day on 31 July 2019.</p>

<p>
Helmed by the STEM Committee, and under the guidance of teachers from the Biology, Chemistry, Computing, Mathematics and Physics departments, over a hundred students came together and worked tirelessly in preparing for the event, which featured booths that sought to showcase how scientific concepts could be applied to authentic situations.</p>

<p>
The college was abuzz with activity as Science came to life. The student ambassadors who were in charge of manning the various subject booths rose to the occasion and impressed their peers with their knowledge and presentations. They did so not only through simple and easily-reproducible demonstrations, but also through their ability to explain complicated concepts in a simple and comprehensible manner, thereby enlightening the general student population about the practical applications of scientific content. The hands-on and interactive nature of the showcases proved to be illuminating as they provided participants with new opportunities to discover their interest and enrich their scientific knowledge; for students who demonstrated strong aptitude in STEM-related fields, the demonstrations served as a good platform for them to delve into deeper discussions with like-minded peers through reasoned discussions, with further insight provided by teacher mentors where necessary.</p>

<p>
All in all, STEM Day was certainly a highlight that took place in the midst of an academically hectic Term 3. An immersive experience, it had definitely brought together students in the college – regardless of their subject combinations – and exposed them to knowledge and skills beyond the curriculum in an engaging and light-hearted manner.</p>
