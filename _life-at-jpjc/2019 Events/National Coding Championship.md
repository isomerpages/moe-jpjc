### **National Coding Championship**
The annual National Coding Championships (NCC) is a platform for students to learn coding in a fun and engaging way. Guiding their on-screen characters through a series of progressively challenging coding quests, students learnt to write codes whilst experiencing the joy of learning.

The finals took place on 18 March 2019 at the National University of Singapore. Unlike previous years, the change in game rules and regulations stiffened the level of competition by allowing every school to send in two teams instead one one. As a result, the JPJC teams had to compete in the senior category which was made up of 32 teams.

Our teams spent the morning coding on Code Combat. Post lunch, using the codes implemented, they battled against opponents in an e-sports fashion. They competed against schools such as National Junior College and Dunman High School. The JPJC team overcame nail-biting rounds to emerge first runner-up in the senior category. Congratulations to the team!
