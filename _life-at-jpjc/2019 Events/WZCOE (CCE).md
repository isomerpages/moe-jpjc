As the West Zone Centre of Excellence for Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), JPJC organised the Schools’ Sharing on Education and Career Guidance (ECG) for key personnel and teachers from secondary schools and junior colleges/centralised institute in the West Zone (WZ) on Wednesday, 27 March 2019. The objectives of the sharing session were:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To encourage sharing of good ECG practices among schools, and</li>
		<li>To provide a platform for participants to network and learn from one another.</li></ul>

<p>
The theme for this year was ‘<i>Enabling our Teachers. Engaging our Students</i>.’  As teachers play a crucial role in guiding students to identify, chart and pursue their ECG goals, it is then vital for educators to be equipped with relevant skills so that they can engage students meaningfully through the various planned programmes.</p>

<p>
This year, the college had the privilege to partner the ECG unit of Guidance Branch (MOE) to conduct a workshop entitled, _Growing Teachers as ECG Advisors_. Based on their different training needs, participants signed up for either the Basic or Enhanced ECG Advising session conducted by the Senior ECG Counsellors and Manager. In addition, Jurong West Secondary School and Westwood Secondary School came on board to share their schools’ good practices aimed at nurturing joy of learning in their students. A total of 27 WZ schools and 79 participants attended the sharing session and gave positive feedback about the workshop. It was a fruitful afternoon of sharing and learning!</p>
