JPJC’s inaugural Service Learning Festival was held on 3rd April 2019. It was a college-wide event aimed at encouraging our students to be active citizens who contribute meaningfully to society. Through the exposure to the various Voluntary Welfare Organisations invited to the college, and the talks organised by them, we hope that students can rally their friends and initiate service-learning projects to contribute back to society by working with the VWOs. A total of 13 external organisations including Harvest Care, Heartware Network and Yellow Ribbon Project participated in the event by setting up informative booths and having their staff and beneficiaries engage our students through the sharing of their social causes and service opportunities.</p>

<p>
Four of these organisations, HCA Hospice Care Young Caregivers team, Muscular Dystrophy Association (Singapore), Ugly Food, and Youth Corps Singapore, helmed sharing sessions for the JC1 students at the lecture theatres, where students had the opportunity to learn more about these organisations, their programmes and how they have been impacting the society. Not to forget, our students from JPJC’s Eco-Club also set up booths to increase the awareness of the school in environmental conservation, as they shared with the college the conservation efforts of Eco-Club and ACRES.</p>

<p>
All the JC1 students participated in the event and discussed what they learnt at the event during their Civics lesson. The festival certainly helped our student learn more about how they can give back to the community and awareness of environmental and conservation issues!</p>
