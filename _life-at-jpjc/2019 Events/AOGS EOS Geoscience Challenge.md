The AOGS-EOS International Geoscience Challenge is a biennial international event, conceptualised by two organisations to bring together science students from around the world to compete, collaborate and innovate in science research that involves the disciplines of Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Geography.</p>

<p>
One of the organisers of this challenge is the Asia Oceania Geosciences Society (AOGS), which is established in 2003 to promote geosciences and its application for the benefit of humanity, specifically in Asia and Oceania and with an overarching approach to global issues. The other organiser, the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS) conducts fundamental research on earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and climate change in and around Southeast Asia, toward safer and more sustainable societies.</p>

<p>
The AOGS-EOS International Geoscience Challenge 2019 which spanned from November 2018 to August 2019 allowed the student participants to experience the execution of an investigative geoscience project and provided them with a platform to exhibit and share their findings with others.</p>

<p>
Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) sent two teams to participate in the Junior College category. There were ten teams from various institutions taking part in the challenge. As part of the competition, the student participants presented their projects to a group of international judges in the field of Geosciences and answered questions pertaining to their projects.</p>

<p>
One of the JPJC teams that investigated the feasibility of solar power in the school campus won the Bronze award in the JC category. The team members consist of Malcolm Koh, Ashley Tay and Rachel Chiang from 18A07. Their research focused on diversifying the schoolâ€™s energy sources through looking at the feasibility of solar power. The team conducted field study to collect temperature data in the school campus as the main requirement to operate the solar panel. For their study analysis, they identified areas which are feasible for the installation of solar panels as well as the monetary benefits in terms of energy cost-savings to the school.</p>
