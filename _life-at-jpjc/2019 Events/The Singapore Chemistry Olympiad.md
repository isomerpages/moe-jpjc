The Singapore Chemistry Olympiad (SChO) 2018 was held on 19 November 2018 at the National University of Singapore, Faculty of Science. This is an annual competition jointly organised by the Singapore National Institute of Chemistry (SNIC), Chemistry Department of National University of Singapore and the Ministry of Education. This competition aims to promote an interest in Chemistry and to provide an opportunity for academically inclined Chemistry JC students to pit their knowledge in Chemistry and spar against students from other institutions. The competition consisted of a theory test and a practical test which was approximately 4-5 hours, taken over two days. The competition was open to all JC/MI and IB schools and was meant for students from JC1 and equivalent.</p>
