In November 2019, Muhammad Ijtihad from 19S23 was selected to be part of the Singapore Combined Schools U18 provisional training squad. Ijtihad not only had to attend regular training sessions up to three times every week, but also play in many friendly matches as part of the rigorous selection process. Ultimately, Ijtihad’s efforts and commitment during training won over the hearts of the selection panel and he was selected to be a member of the 2019 U18 Combined Schools Football team representing Singapore at the Asian U18 Schools Championship in Indonesia. Ijtihad also started both games for the team at the tournament, gaining invaluable experience in these matches. It was an incredible honour and privilege for him to represent the country at an international tournament. With this experience under his belt, he looks forward to leading Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s Football team to greater heights at this year’s National School Games Football Championship.</p>
