### **Jurong Spring Family Day Walk**
On 7 July 2019, a group of Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) students from class 19S25 organised a fun-filled carnival to engage around 800 Jurong Spring residents. This carnival served to complement the annual family walk event organised by the Jurong Spring Community Sports Club (CSC) that aimed to promote an active and healthy lifestyle.

Using recycled materials like plastic bottles and boxes, our students created simple exercise equipment for the elderly. In addition, they set up game booths for the participants to play with their peers and family members. Upon participation in all the booths, the participants could redeem healthy food items such as bread, and vegetables. To increase the residents’ awareness on emergency readiness, our students from CD Lionhearters also set up an outreach booth to share with the participants on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with hands-on practice on a dummy.

Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development and Member of Parliament, graced the event. He joined the residents for the walk and participated in the games. At the end of the carnival, he presented certificates of appreciation to the student volunteers who rendered their service in this project.

The students felt that their Sunday was spent on a meaningful and fulfilling project as they brought joy to the participants. All in all, the event was a resounding success!
