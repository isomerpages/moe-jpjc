### **International Friendship Day Commemoration**
Our college’s commemoration of International Friendship Day (IFD) 2021 took place in the context of the continuing COVID-19 global crisis, which brought both challenges and opportunities for Singapore. It reminded us of the importance of international collaboration and cooperation. In line with Singapore’s prominent role in leading the COVAX scheme to ensure the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally, the 2021 theme for IFD is ‘Singapore in the World’, highlighting the importance of maintaining good relationships in view of the changing global landscapes and the complexities of the world.

Our students were able to acquire a better appreciation of the political and economic benefits to Singapore’s leading involvement in COVAX during their IFD-infused General Paper tutorials. Our JC2 students went a step further by enhancing their understanding of the diplomatic challenges faced by Singapore in trying to fulfil the idealistic aims of COVAX, through a creative student-initiated Civics lesson package designed by students from the Community Engagement Council (CEC) and International Current Affairs Society (ICAS).

Our JC1 students gained awareness of Singapore’s Foreign Policy Principles and reflected on the importance of international collaboration and cooperation as countries address global issues such as COVID-19.  Students first watched a video prepared by ICAS on Singapore’s achievements and collaborations in the diplomatic front and measures taken by Singapore to play its part in the global community. Furthermore, JC1 students also learnt more about some of Singapore foreign policies through their discussion in areas like economic competitiveness, climate change, public health and cyber security. In closing our commemoration of this meaningful day, students participated in an interactive IFD online quiz, and the top 5 scorers from each cohort were awarded prizes for their answers. All in all, this was a refreshing take on the conventional IFD commemoration activities of previous years.
