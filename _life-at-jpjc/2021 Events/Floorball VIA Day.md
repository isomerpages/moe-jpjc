### **Floorball VIA Day**
On the 25th of February, Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) Floorball team held its inaugural Values in Action (VIA) session for 2021. This VIA event saw the Floorball team rendering their service to the college by organising a Floorball clinic for interested JPJC staff, as part of the Staff Wellness Activity Day in Term 1. When offered the opportunity to impart their knowledge and skills on Floorball, the team jumped at the chance, and it was an exciting experience for both the student facilitators and staff participants. One of the student facilitators, Zaer Pang (20S01), reflected that the VIA was a very enjoyable and unique experience as he got to know a few teachers who did not teach him, and felt that the team could hone their skills through teaching others of different age groups with differing sporting abilities. In addition, another student facilitator Joshua Ang Yu Han (20S17) reflected that the session brought him a lot of excitement when he saw that the teachers enjoyed themselves and were eager to learn a sport that the team loved. The session also honed his coaching abilities. All in all, the VIA session was an enriching learning experience for both staff and students, and has also brought the JPJC Floorball team closer together, strengthening their teamwork and bonds.
