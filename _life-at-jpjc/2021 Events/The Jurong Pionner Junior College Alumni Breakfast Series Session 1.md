Jeremy Chin, from the Class of 2014, was the first alumnus to kickstart Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) Alumni Breakfast Series for 2021. This programme is organised by the college’s Partnerships and Outreach Committee with the objective of giving our students opportunities to learn from and build networks with our inspiring and distinguished alumni.  On 4 March 2021, Jeremy met with a group of 31 eager students via virtual conferencing and shared about his academic journey from junior college, to his undergraduate studies in the United Kingdom and subsequently his postgraduate stint in the Netherlands. Jeremy, who is also a Public Service Commission Scholarship recipient, shared tips on how to prepare one’s portfolio for scholarship applications and scholarship interviews. The students were highly engaged by Jeremy’s frank and personal sharing of his life experiences and had many questions for him during the Question and Answer segment. It was truly a precious opportunity for students to gain greater awareness and understanding of the higher education landscape, as well as the demands of the working world. The session ended with Jeremy encouraging his juniors to “dare to venture” as he urged them to step out of their comfort zones and explore various interests, so as to broaden their horizons and acquire new skills that would help them progress into the future.</p>
