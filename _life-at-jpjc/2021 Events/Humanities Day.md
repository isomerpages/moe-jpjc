Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) Humanities Day took place on 4 August with the launch of a website created by students from the Arts & Social Sciences Interest Programme (ARTSSIP). This year’s theme ‘Mind, Body and Soul’ was conceptualised by the ARTSSIP students who wanted to prompt their peers to think about their physical and mental states, and consider what exactly constitutes the historically-debated matter of the ‘soul’. The ARTSSIP students started work on planning the website and conducting research since end of May.</p>

<p>
The final product was a website that explored five interesting topics, namely, ethical dilemmas, identity crisis, capital punishment, pejoratives, and the law. The ARTSSIP students wanted to use these topics to evoke more critical thinking among JPJC students regarding the importance and relevance of the humanities to the world we live in.</p>

<p>
Apart from visiting the website, JPJC students and staff also participated in a quiz based on the website content. By the end of the week, six JC1 and JC2 students emerged as winners of the Humanities Day quiz, owing to their insightful reflections on the theme and the issues presented on the website.</p>
