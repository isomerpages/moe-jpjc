The second Alumni Breakfast Series virtual sharing of the year organised by the Jurong Pioneer Junior College Partnerships and Outreach Committee was held on 15 April. 21 students from JC1 and JC2 attended the sharing by our alumnus Ms Stephanie Lee from Pioneer Junior College’s class of 2014, where she shared about her journey, from junior college and university to her current career as a pharmacist at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. A Ministry of Health Holdings (MOHH) scholarship recipient, Stephanie also shared how she prepared for scholarship applications and interviews. Throughout the session, our students were highly engaged and had many questions for her during the Question and Answer segment. It was a truly precious opportunity for the students to gain a greater awareness and understanding about life in university, the rigour of Pharmacy as a varsity specialisation, as well as the exciting roles and job scope of a pharmacist. At the end of the session, Stephanie shared this piece of advice for her juniors: “Never stop trying new things and exploring different interests, and build connections with people you meet as you journey on in life. In short, live life to the fullest!”</p>
