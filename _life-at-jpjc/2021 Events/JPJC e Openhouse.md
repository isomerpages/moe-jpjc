Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) e-Open House was held on 12 January 2021, a day after the GCE ‘O’ Level Results Release. Our e-Open House provided prospective parents and students an insight into our college’s enriching programmes and school experience.</p>

<p>
In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Partnerships and Outreach Committee came together last November to envision and bring to fruition a virtual open house for the college. To overcome the constraints that Safe Management Measures and appropriate social distancing posed to face-to-face outreach and publicity efforts, three event teaser videos with different themes were conceptualised and filmed. These videos provided a glimpse of the JPJC experience from the perspectives of current students, our alumni and parents.</p>

<p>
Prior to the e-Open House day, we also shared event teaser videos on various social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.  The variety of perspectives as well as rich and authentic sharing in these videos provided prospective students a better understanding of the JPJC experience. With the teaser videos attracting more than 2500 views on Instagram before the event, there was definitely quite some buzz generated in anticipation of the actual e-Open House session!</p>

<p>
On the day of our e-Open House, around 260 registered participants attended the webinar hosted by our School Leaders. Close to 200 participants also joined us in subsequent subject information-related sessions helmed by our Heads of Department (HODs) on Zoom. There was also special interest in the e-sessions on JPJC’s niche programmes – namely, the Language Elective Programme and Talent & Leadership Development Programme. Participants joined our HODs, teachers as well as officers from the Ministry of Education’s Curriculum Planning and Development Division online, to learn more about how they could pursue their interests and passion in these niche areas in our college. During the various sessions, our school leaders and HODs addressed questions submitted by participants ‘live’, which included queries on the college’s academic curriculum, talent and leadership development and special programmes. For prospective students who were unable to join us on e-Open House day, the college also put up recordings of all the webinar sessions, as well as a list of answers for questions fielded during the Q&A sessions, on the college’s website.</p>

<p>
Organising the 2020 virtual Open House was indeed a learning experience for the college, where we worked through the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and explored new medium and methods of engagement. We look forward to students joining the JPJC family, to join us in this journey of learning and innovation!</p>
