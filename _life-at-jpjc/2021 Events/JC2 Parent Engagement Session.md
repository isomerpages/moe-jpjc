<h3><strong>JC2 Parent Engagement – Touching Base with Parents</strong></h3>

<p>
Amidst measures taken by Jurong Pioneer Junior College to ensure students’ safety and effective learning in this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, parents were not forgotten. An online Parent Engagement session was organised on Thursday, 21 Jan 2021, where members of the School Management Committee shared with all parents of our JC2 students the school programmes and support for the JC2 students in their graduating year. Our Education and Career Guidance Counsellor, Ms Michelle Lee, also responded to questions on future education options and admissions. Though the webinar was held on a Thursday evening, parents participated enthusiastically, with a number engaging in the Q&A session helmed by the School Leaders. It was an enriching session for all, and the college will continue to work closely with parents to support and enhance the college experience of our students.</p>
