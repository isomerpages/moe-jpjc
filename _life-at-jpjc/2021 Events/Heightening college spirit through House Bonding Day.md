Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s House activities for 2021 began with the first House Bonding Day held on 3 March 2021. The timing of the event was apt as the JC1s had just settled into college life and were eager to be introduced to their respective new Houses.</p>

<p>
On the day itself, students of all six houses gathered in their respective homerooms and participated in challenging team-building activities. Held entirely within the respective classrooms to prevent intermingling, the well-designed activities aimed to build House spirit. To this end, the classes worked on activities that required a cumulative effort to complete and compete as a House to achieve common house goals.  House Executive Committee (Exco) members and Orientation Group Leaders facilitated the activities, which were coordinated by the Exco members of Volans and Taurus houses as well as the Student Council Vice-President (House).</p>

<p>
The first challenge was to build a 3D sculpture. This required good planning, coordination and skilful craftsmanship as the 3D sculpture had to be mounted on the classroom noticeboard. There was much fun during the process and the students created commendable sculptures that were made entirely from recyclable materials.  Following this, a secret mission was thrust upon the students that set them scrambling to look for items that symbolised their respective houses. The goal for each house was to collect as many unique items as possible – the more, the merrier!  To top it off, students took on the ‘Together, We Build Challenge’ which was a tricky game of coordination to build a three-tier pyramid of six cups.</p>

<p>
As the afternoon of fun and excitement came to an end, students left college in batches, ensuring that Safe Management Measures were once again observed. Despite the constraints presented by the pandemic, the first House Bonding Day of 2021 ended with high spirits and a greater sense of camaraderie among all students.</p>
