### **E-Immersion Programme**
The inaugural E-Immersion Programme was successfully held on 4 August and 11 August.

MTL department has worked closely with our overseas partner school (No.1 High School affiliated to East China Normal University 上海华东师范大学第一附属中学) since 2013 and had organised annual Cultural Exchange Programme since then. The programme was halted in 2020 due to COVID-19 situation and this year, the department ran an E-immersion Programme with the theme “Global Cultural Exchange in the Post Pandemic World”.

For one of the segments, which was "Discovering our Neighbourhoods", students from JPJC and our partner school presented and introduced different parts of Singapore and Shanghai respectively. The virtual exchange is definitely an enriching experience for both group of participants.

The E-Immersion Programme was well received by the students as they found the forum informative and engaging, and they looked forward to more interactions in future.
