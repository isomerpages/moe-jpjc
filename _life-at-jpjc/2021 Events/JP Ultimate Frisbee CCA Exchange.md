On 21 April 2021, Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s JC2 Ultimate Frisbee (ULTI) and Outdoor Activities Club (ODAC) team members participated in a Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) exchange session. The main aim of the session was to learn new skills and knowledge for members of both CCA groups. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, all activities were conducted with strict adherence to Safe Management Measures and Ministry of Education guidelines on physical activities.</p>

<p>
The day began with an orienteering segment by ODAC members, who taught the ULTI team basic orienteering skills such as proper map-reading, identifying symbols and following directions. Afterwards, there was a friendly competition amongst the ULTI members for them to apply these skills they picked up. This competition allowed the ULTI team to practice their newly learnt navigation skills under the pressure of time to score points. Points were awarded based on the number of stamps, order of the stamps collected and the timing at which teams finished collecting these stamps.</p>

<p>
In the latter half of the CCA exchange, ULTI members conducted a crash course on the basic rules of Ultimate Frisbee, teaching ODAC members some of the basic throwing and catching methods such as forehand and backhand throws, as well as the pancake catch. After the training segment, the ULTI team engaged in a friendly match with the ODAC members, providing them with an opportunity to try out the new skills they had learnt. In all, it was a fruitful and enriching opportunity for members of both CCAs to master new skills beyond the classroom and have fun in a safe and enjoyable manner.</p>
