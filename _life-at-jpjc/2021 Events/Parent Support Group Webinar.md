Given that the Junior College (JC) journey could be unfamiliar territory for many parents and guardians, Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) Partnerships & Outreach Committee and Full Time School Counsellors (FTSCs) worked together to conduct a webinar on how parents can better support teens through their JC years. Our FTSCs, Mrs Estelle Ow and Ms Elaine Tay shared insights into the mind and behaviour of teenagers. They provided helpful pointers on identifying the challenges teenagers face, such as their transition to JC, managing stress, and handling peer relations. Our FTSCs also shared parenting tips related to communicating with teenage children and supporting them emotionally.</p>

Illustrating the important role that parents, in partnership with teachers, play in guiding their teenage child along their JC journey, our JPJC Parent Support Group (PSG) Chairperson, Madam Bee Hwee Fang also did a special sharing on how she supports her two teenagers, one of whom is a JC2 JPJC student.</p>

Through these sharing sessions, the college hopes to strength our partnership with parents in supporting our students throughout their JC experience. The positive turnout during the webinar showed that many parents were interested to learn more about specific and guided approaches to helping their teenagers.  In their feedback, the parent attendees shared that they had developed a deeper awareness of the importance of the school-home partnership in raising resilient and healthy children. Many parents reflected that they found the sharing enriching and applicable, and said they looked forward to more of such sharing sessions in the future.</p>
