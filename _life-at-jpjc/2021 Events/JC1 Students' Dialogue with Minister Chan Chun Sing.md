On Monday, 11 October, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service Mr Chan Chun Sing visited JPJC. 16 of our JC1 students, all representing the various niche programmes and interest groups of the college, had the privilege to engage Minister Chan in a small-group dialogue. They shared with him their personal interests as well as plans and aspirations for their future. A few students expressed their interest in joining the teaching profession whilst there were others who have set their sight on fields related to cyber-security, science & engineering, journalism, and psychology. In response to the varied interests and aspirations shared by the students, Minister Chan encouraged them to always find time to learn beyond the 'textbooks' and pursue life skills and interests that would better prepare them for our constantly evolving world.</p>

Thank you Minister Chan for the enriching dialogue with our students, and reinforcing the true meaning of our college motto, "While I Live, I Learn. Plus Ultra"!</p>
