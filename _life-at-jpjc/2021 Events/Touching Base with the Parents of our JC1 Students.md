On 25 February 2021, Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) School Leaders and Heads of Department had a virtual meeting with the parents of our JC1 students. The JC1 Parents’ Engagement Webinar, held on a Thursday evening from 5.30-6.30pm, saw a good turnout with enthusiastic participation from the parents.</p>

<p>
The session began with our Principal, Dr Hang Kim Hoo, welcoming the parents. Our Vice-Principal (Education), Mr Nah Hong Leong then shared with parents the college’s Total Curriculum Framework and Self-Regulation Framework, which the college incorporated in the total development of our students. Mr Nah also explained to parents the details of implementing Blended Learning – a definitive feature in the schooling experience of their children. He highlighted that Blended Learning was aimed at developing students’ ability to be self-directed, passionate and life-long learners. Mr Nah also spent some time discussing the rigour of the ‘A’ Level syllabus and enlightening parents about the JC1 Assessment Policy & Promotion Criteria, which was a point of concern for many of the parents.</p>

The next part of the webinar was dedicated to informing parents about the college’s Support Structure for students’ well-being. Our JC1 Year Head, Mr Koh Chit Siong took over and shared pertinent details on the college calendar, support structure and assessment milestones. Mr Koh also brought parents through some of the Safe Management Measures that had been put in place by the college to ensure the physical well-being and safety of students, assuring parents that their children were in good hands.</p>

The JC1 Parents’ Engagement Webinar was an enriching session for all, and the college will continue to work closely with parents to foster greater home-school partnership to ensure the holistic development of all students.</p>
