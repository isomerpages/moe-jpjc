### **GCE 'A' Level Results Release Day**
On the 19th of February, Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) welcomed back her second batch of students for the release of the 2020 GCE A Level Examination results. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for Safe Management Measures, all returning graduands were required to complete an online health declaration form before they were permitted to return to college to collect their results. They were also given the option of viewing their results online.

Measures such as temperature screening (with stations both at the college’s main gate and foyer) were put in place, and the Class of 2019 received their results in separate classrooms. In an effort to reduce intermingling, a staggered dismissal timing system was also adopted to disperse all students from college earlier, and our current JC2 students were allowed to view their 2020 GCE A Level Mother Tongue Examination results online. The smooth implementation of these measures was possible thanks to the collaborative efforts of all JPJC staff and students, in a bid to allow college life to go on normally, but safely for everyone.

Such a situation did nothing to dampen the excitement and anticipation of the Class of 2019 and all JPJC staff, about the results release. It was a heartwarming sight to see our returning graduands reuniting for this occasion. Our returning students were happy to meet their teachers and classmates – some of whom they had not seen for some time – and catch up with them. Given the great challenges that the Class of 2019 had to face and overcome in preparing for their A Level examinations in 2020, they have put up a good fight and done commendably. In the words of our Principal, Dr. Hang Kim Hoo, “Overall, despite the COVID-19 situation, the cohort did well. What is clear is that our college’s focus on self-regulation is extremely important and timely in this context where blended learning takes centrestage.” Equipping all our students, including the Class of 2019, with self-management skills was and is crucial in enabling them to take charge of their own learning, recognise gaps, seek help from their teachers and take action in a timely manner to accomplish their goals.

To all our JPJC teachers and staff, a big thank you for your unwavering support and dedication to our students’ learning and development in the midst of great challenges last year. To the Class of 2019, congratulations, and we wish you all the best as you embark on a new journey ahead of you!
