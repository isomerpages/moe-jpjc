### **Teachers' Day**
_'Cheers to our ‘Chers’_ – a toast to salute our teachers and their passion for holistically nurturing students, especially in this time of the pandemic and its almost daily challenges. This toast was also the theme for the college’s Teachers’ Day Celebration this year. It showcased students’ heartfelt gratitude for the myriad responsibilities teachers undertake to steer their charges towards success.

Held on Thursday, 2 September, the celebration was planned by the 4th Student Council and executed by the Class Managers (CMs) and the Class Executive Committee (EXCO) members in the respective classrooms in light of the need for Safe Management Measures.

The celebration kicked off with an opening video address by our Principal, Dr Hang Kim Hoo. Following the address, the CMs displayed creativity and great teamwork with their Class Exco in leading the various bonding activities with their Civics Tutors. The celebration also featured video interviews of some teachers who reminisced their time as students and who were deeply grateful to their teachers, some of whom are their colleagues today. Ending the celebration was the announcement of the winners of the Teachers’ Day Awards which were given out by Dr Hang.

The excitement shared by the entire college in commemorating this important occasion will surely remain a pleasant memory etched in all of our hearts for a long time to come. Cheers to our ‘Chers’ always!
