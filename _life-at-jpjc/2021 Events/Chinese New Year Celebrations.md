<h4><strong>Chinese New Year Celebration 2021: A New Beginning</strong></h4>

<p>
Held on the 11th of February, the Chinese New Year (CNY) celebration brought the Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) family together to welcome the year of the Ox with much anticipation for ‘A New Beginning’, which was the theme of this year’s celebration.</p>

<p>
One of the highlights of this year’s celebration was a special heart-warming segment where the school’s Operations Support Officers (OSOs) were honoured for their tireless contributions to the school amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The Community Engagement Council (CEC) partnered with the Staff Welfare Committee to present the OSOs with CNY gift hampers. These hampers contained gifts contributed by JPJC staff and cards handmade by the CEC members. Over 20 OSOs received gift hampers one day before the eve of CNY, bringing much cheer and encouragement to these unsung heroes of the college.</p>

The rest of the celebration was conducted with the need for Safe Management Measures (SMM) in mind. Teachers joined their students to watch the virtual concert screened in their respective homerooms. This pre-recorded concert segment included performances by the Chinese Orchestra, the Malay Cultural Society and the Symphonic Band. The performers put together an impressive concert despite the challenges of not being able to practise together in person. Also, stepping up to facilitate the celebration were the Orientation Group Leaders who planned surprises for teachers and school leaders, as well as entertained all classes with various activities. These activities included conducting CNY quizzes and craft activities for the celebration. The handicraft segment yielded great delight and commendable works of art for all, with some classes even decorating their homerooms with their handmade CNY-themed items. The celebration ended with a House Photo Collage showcase, comprising photos submitted by all classes and put together by the respective House Captains.</p>

Despite celebrating with SMM in place, the JPJC family has indeed partaken of the festive spirit and enjoyed ourselves in a creative but still united manner this year.</p>
