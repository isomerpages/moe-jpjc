### **Term 1 Staff Wellness Activities Day: An invigorating and fun start to the day**
Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s first Staff Wellness Activities Day in 2021 was held on 25 February. Prior to the day, staff were presented with a slew of activities to sign up for – and these ranged from the vigorous, to more fun and leisurely activities. The wellness activities planned included the Park Connector Network (PCN) Walk/Run, Workstation Stretching, Zumba, Qigong, Have Fun Hunting (Treasure Hunt) and Floorball.

Anticipation ran high on the day itself. Early birds, who included the Year Heads for both levels, Mr Koh Chit Siong and Mr Subash Ramiah, sped off to the park connector for their run as others assembled at the different venues for their activities. Teachers worked out and stretched their muscles, whether they were ambling, running, dancing or stretching. To spice things up, the PCN participants were encouraged to take snapshots of themselves or of colleagues, or of any interesting object that they encountered along the way, caption them and post them on Padlet. The enthusiasm was overwhelming, with many taking selfies of themselves in interesting poses. The group with the entry entitled “Exactly 8! Huat Ah!” was treated to a well-deserved prize of a café voucher. Photographs of the other staff in action were also posted to Padlet for all to view. It was delightful to see many happy faces, despite the sweat on their brows. The event ended with teachers feeling invigorated from the fun and conviviality experienced, ready to face the rest of the work day on a high note!

Maintaining our physical well-being is vital in ensuring good mental health and wellness.  JPJC’s first Staff Wellness Activities Day marks the beginning of a consistent journey with teachers taking the lead in role modelling healthy habits and routines for both our physical and mental well-being, so as to encourage our students do the same!
