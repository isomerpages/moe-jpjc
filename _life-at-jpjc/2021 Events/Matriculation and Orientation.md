Jurong Pioneer Junior College's (JPJC) Matriculation and Orientation (M & O) for our incoming JC1 freshmen this year was held from 29 January to 5 February 2021. Drawing inspiration from Mount Olympus, the tallest mountain in Greece, the theme for this year's M & O was Olympian, as a form of encouragement to our freshmen to scale their own mountains and defy and conquer all insurmountable odds they may face. As a cornerstone Student Council event involving over 190 Student Councillors (SCs) and Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs), M & O is undoubtedly one of the most significant milestones for every freshman. M & O 2021 served as an induction and rite of passage for all incoming JC1 students, where they gained insights on various aspects of life in JPJC, and forged bonds with their peers.</p>

In the course of M & O, JC1 students were given ample opportunities to spend time with their teachers and seniors, through bonding sessions and games. All JC1 students had immense fun during the games segment, even as they developed valuable qualities such as teamwork and resilience. The inclusion of a physical college tour also allowed them to familiarise themselves with the college environment, but was made more interactive with the addition of pop quizzes to help them remember various venues more quickly. Another highlight of the programme saw our JC1 students filming House TikTok videos and making House e-banners all of which helped to build a stronger house spirit in the JC1 cohort. In light of the need for Safe Management Measures (SMM) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no mass cheer activities held. Instead, the JC1 students were given more time to learn two unique college dances. M & O 2021 ended off on a high note with the grand finale, which included the majestic House Corridor March as well as an opportunity for everyone to dance their hearts out to the college dances with their classes in their respective venues according to SMM. It was truly a sight to behold, and a memorable finale to JPJC’s week-long welcome to our incoming JC1 cohort.</p>
