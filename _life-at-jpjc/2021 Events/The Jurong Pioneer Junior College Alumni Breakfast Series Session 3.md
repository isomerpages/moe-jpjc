The third instalment of the Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) Alumni Breakfast Series for 2021 was held on 12 August. Mr Jasper Chan from the Class of 2011 shared about his journey, from being a student of Jurong Junior College to reading law at the Singapore Management University, and to his eventual Masters stint at the Nottingham Trent University. Upon completion of his studies, Jasper was called to the Singapore Bar in 2019 and is currently a Regulatory Counsel with the Law Society of Singapore.</p>

Eight enthusiastic JC1 students who hope to pursue a law degree in future participated earnestly, and asked Jasper about a career in the legal profession during the Question and Answer segment. It was a beneficial interaction session as our students were able to gain valuable insights on both the highlights and challenges of the legal profession. Edward Tang (21A07), who hosted the sharing session, shared that “Mr Chan’s sharing allowed me to understand at a deeper level what it really takes to kick start a career in the legal field, the challenges I can expect and how I can work towards overcoming these challenges. I am now more aware of the different aspects of being a lawyer and the responsibilities that come with working in different areas of the legal profession.”</p>
