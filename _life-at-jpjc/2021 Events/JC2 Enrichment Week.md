Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s Enrichment Week this year was held from 29 January to 5 February 2021. All JC2 students who were not involved as Orientation Group Leaders in Matriculation and Orientation 2021 participated in a week’s worth of activities that allowed them to extend their learning experience beyond the classroom.</p>

Even though all activities were held online via virtual platforms, students were treated to a wide range of enriching opportunities for learning. In the aspect of General Paper, they had the privilege to hear from United Women Singapore regarding human rights and activism for gender equality. Our students also had the opportunity to sign up for a wide array of Education and Career Guidance (ECG) talks. Representatives and alumni from the six local autonomous universities shared enthusiastically about the programmes and experiences varsity life had to offer to prospective students. Rich insights were also provided by representatives from the Singapore Land Authority, Building and Construction Authority and Ministry of Health, all of whom shared much useful tips regarding scholarship application and job opportunities with interested students. Some key highlights of the ECG talks included an Alumni talk who spoke about her journey in pursuing her dreams in the food technology sector and a CEO of reputed Organic Foods company, Zenxin Organic, who shared about entrepreneurial dare and the importance of pursuing one’s passion.</p>

All in all, it was a fruitful week of exposure for our JC2 cohort as they learnt about the vast array of exciting possibilities that awaited them beyond their junior college journey. It also served as a form of motivation for them to work more purposefully towards their goals and dreams.</p>
