The Orientation Group Leaders’ Camp (OGLC) held from 4 to 6 January 2021 was designed to develop our Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) to lead in Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s Matriculation and Orientation 2021. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic situation and the need for Safe Monitoring Measures (SMM), a revised three-day camp with Home-Based Learning packages replaced the traditional three-day two-night face-to-face camp. During the camp, our OGLs were split into groups within their Houses, and they bonded over a variety of activities. These activities also helped to develop crucial skills such as teamwork, critical thinking and instil greater confidence in our OGLs.</p>

<p>
Some highlights of OGLC included:
<ul>
	<li>The Communication and Managing Difficult Persons Workshop, where our OGLs learnt effective communication and conflict resolution. They discussed possible challenging scenarios, in preparation for their interactions with the freshmen during Matriculation and Orientation 2021.</li>
	<li>The Ice Breakers and Games segment, in which OGLs were given the opportunity to apply and hone skills, such as collaboration, creativity and communication, that they had learnt in the abovementioned workshop.</li>
	<li>Debrief Sessions, which allowed the OGLs to provide feedback to one another and share their opinions. This also gave them the opportunity to become more confident in speaking up in front of others.</li>
	<li>House bonding activities, which included dance practices and the making of House emblems. These activities allowed the OGLs to step out of their comfort zones to lead others. It also helped to foster a strong House spirit, which we hope to build among our freshmen as well.</li>
	<li>Under the guidance of the Student Council Teacher Advisors, OGLC was indeed an effective platform for building both leadership competencies and strength of character in students.</li></ul>

<p>
Through this camp, the OGLs have grown, and it is our hope that they will now be effective leaders and positive role models for their juniors in the upcoming Matriculation and Orientation 2021.</p>
