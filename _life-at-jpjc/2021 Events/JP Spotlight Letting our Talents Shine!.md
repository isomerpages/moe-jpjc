### **JP Spotlight – Letting Our Talents Shine!**
Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s signature talent competition, JP Spotlight, returned for its third edition in 2021 after a hiatus in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Preparations for the event began in January with the recruitment of students for the Organising Committee. Under the guidance of the event’s Teacher Mentors, Mr Oh Keng Yong and Ms Tan Ying Xin, the team meticulously planned and executed the event to ensure a smooth and fruitful experience for all participants.

The event aimed to provide a platform for students to develop and showcase their talents, as well as to enhance the appreciation of the performing arts within the college. After an intense round of audition, eight groups of participants proceeded to the Final, which was held on 26 March 2021 at the college hall. In keeping with the need for social distancing and Safe Management Measures, the Final was live-streamed to the school population via YouTube Live. Despite the lack of a live audience, the finalists eagerly showcased their talents in the various performing arts genres ranging from rock band to K-Pop dance. In the end, Chantel Chan Xin Kai from 20S23 was crowned the champion for her delightful rendition of “I’m Yours” by Jason Mraz on an ukelele, while Zou Zirui from 21S19 was voted as winner of the Audience's Choice award for her dance cover of "Me Gustas Tu" by GFriend.

Overall, the event was well received by both participants and audience with a total of 952 views on YouTube Live. True to its motto – ‘Light up the stage, let your talents shine’ – JP Spotlight served as a visible reminder of the tremendous potential of our students and how they can readily rise to the occasion when given a stage!
