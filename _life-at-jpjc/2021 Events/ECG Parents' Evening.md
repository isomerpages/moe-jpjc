### **ECG Parents’ Evening**
Our college’s annual ECG (Further Education and Career Guidance) Parents’ Evening was held on Friday, 7 May 2021, via a Zoom Webinar. This was an event specially organised for parents, comprising a presentation by each of our 6 local university partners (Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore University of Social Sciences, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore Management University, Nanyang Technological University and National University of Singapore), followed by a Q&A segment. The objective of the event was to provide parents with an update on university admission requirements, as well as the new courses offered by our local universities in the light of the changing higher education landscape, so that they could better engage their children in conversations on their children’s higher education options.

The event was very well-received, with close to 300 parents attending the virtual session. It was a fruitful and insightful session for parents as they were informed on the latest developments in the higher education landscape and had the valuable opportunity to have their questions answered by the speakers during the Q&A segment.
