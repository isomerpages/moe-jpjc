### **e-STEM Day**
Similar to 2020, the circumstances brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic imposed continued restrictions and rendered the conduct of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) activities through in-person experiments and demonstrations unfeasible. Nevertheless, true to the spirit of learning and the objectives of the STEM programme at JPJC, the learning intended for STEM Day 2021 continued on Deck Toys, an online platform which allowed for the exploration of various STEM disciplines in a gamified manner.

Kickstarting eSTEM Day 2021 via a video address, our Principal Dr Hang Kim Hoo spoke astutely about how skills in STEM are imperative in ensuring one’s relevance in today’s world, where multi-disciplinary knowledge and skills are increasingly in demand. With the context set, students were then better able to appreciate the application of the featured STEM concepts and skills to authentic situations as they navigated the challenges on Deck Toys thereafter.

By the end of the week-long event, 21S02, 20S22, 20S12, 20S07 and 21S17 emerged as the classes with the highest participation rate and were awarded attractive vouchers, much to students’ delight. Students Pham Hoang Vu Linh, Yap Rui Ting and Koh Jia Ler won individual prizes for completing the challenges most quickly. The challenge was also well-received amongst staff members across different departments. It was indeed especially encouraging to such enthusiastic participation, and heartening to see a flourishing STEM culture at JPJC, as well as a great interest in STEM and its related applications.
