### **Pre-University Seminar**
From 1 to 4 June 2021, a 20-strong student delegation represented Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) at the Pre-University Seminar 2021.

This annual prestigious seminar brings together students from pre-university institutions from across the nation to discuss and collaborate on issues related to Singapore. The theme of the seminar this year was "Stronger", with three sub-themes - ‘Tougher’, ‘Bolder’ and ‘Kinder’. Some of the aims of the seminar were to deepen participants’ understanding of the Singapore identity and values in the evolving social, economic and political context; raise participants’ awareness of the opportunities and challenges for Singapore amid this period of disruption and transformation; and nurture teamwork and camaraderie among participants across institutions.

For close to 2 months prior to the event, our students collaborated with participants from other institutions grouped under the same sub-theme for projects, discussions, e-learning journeys and dialogues with specialists to cover issues pertaining to possible innovations, adaptations, and redefinitions for Singapore.

Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the seminar was conducted entirely online. Despite the constraints, true to one of its aims, participants adapted using a variety of tools, including Mentimeter, Padlet, as well as integrating video conferencing and webinar formats to facilitate discussions for large groups.

During the seminar, participants engaged in dialogues with the Minister for Education, Mr Chan Chun Sing, and with the Second Minister for Education, Mr Maliki Osman, on their vision, concerns for Singapore, and Singapore’s role on the global stage in future. Another highlight was the human libraries segment, where speakers shared their wealth of experiences in their unique fields. Our students were privileged to have a distinguished panel comprising Mr Aaron Maniam, poet and Deputy Director at Ministry of Communications and Information, Ms Jessica Cheam, Founder and Managing Editor of Eco-Business, and Mr Chng Kai Fong, Managing Director of Economic Development Board. The panel discussions touched on issues close to their hearts such as sustainability and mental wellness. Participants’ reflections and insights for each segment were posted on the seminar website, adding another layer of sharing that concluded a refreshing and meaningful Pre-University Seminar.
