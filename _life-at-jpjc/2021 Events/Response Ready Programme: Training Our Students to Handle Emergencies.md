Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s Emergency & Safety Committee organised the Response Ready Programme (RRP) for 31 JC1 students on 14 and 21 April 2021. The two-day training programme is part of the Community Emergency Preparedness Programme (CEPP). It focused on core lifesaving skills and essential emergency procedures, with a greater emphasis on practical hands-on engagement.</p>

<p>
Prior to attending the practical training, all participants completed an online e-learning module to equip them with the necessary knowledge of these skills and procedures. During the practical session, participants were able to apply a number of lifesaving skills they had learnt. For instance, students performed Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) on dummy models and the use of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). Other skills learnt included attending to a choking person, using Improvised First Aid Skills (IFAS) to stop excessive bleeding and fire-fighting using a fire extinguisher.</p>

<p>
The training sessions were conducted by personnel from the Community Engagement Branch, 4th Division of the Singapore Civil Defence Force. In all, our student participants found the RRP meaningful, as they were able to master such critical lifeskills crucial to saving lives when such a need arises in the future.</p>
