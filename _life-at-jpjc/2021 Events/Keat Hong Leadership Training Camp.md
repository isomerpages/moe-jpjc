### **Keat Hong Leadership Training Camp**
On 2 June 2021, the Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) Scholars Development Committee organised a Leadership Training Camp (LTC) in collaboration with Keat Hong Community Club. This was an annual initiative organised as part of the Community LEAD (Leadership Exploration and Development programme) and was aimed at Secondary One and Two students from the schools around Chua Chu Kang Constituency as well as the W2 cluster. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, Grassroots Advisor to the Chua Chu Kang Group Representation Constituency (CCK GRC), was the Guest of Honour for this event. This year marked a record number in the number of student participants, with a total of 123 participants from five secondary schools, namely Chua Chu Kang Secondary, Dunearn Secondary, Hillgrove Secondary, Nanyang Girls High School and Unity Secondary.

Traditionally conducted as a two-day programme, this workshop took the form of a half-day online Zoom session this year in compliance with the Safe Management Measures in Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). With the help of 45 JPJC facilitators from the college’s Scholars Development Programme, the workshop helped to develop leadership competencies in young student leaders through games, activities, missions and reflections. One notable activity was the Hero Costume design activity, where participants were guided to depict their fears, insecurities, hopes and aspirations as a leader through drawings. These drawings were subsequently used for further discussions with participants, about establishing peer support networks and target setting.

At the end of the workshop, student representatives from the various schools shared with one another what they have gained from the workshop. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim also shared his leadership philosophy with all participants in his closing address for the event. LTC@Keat Hong 2021 was indeed a meaningful and enriching event, where student leaders from JPJC were able to make a positive impact to the community by imparting their skills in the mentorship of others.
