### **GCE A Level Results Release Day**
On the 21st of February, Jurong Pioneer Junior College welcomed its inaugural batch of students back for the release of results for the 2019 GCE A Level Examination. In light of the Covid-19 situation, a number of precautionary measures were taken by the college to safeguard the health and safety of everyone involved. All former students from the Class of 2018 were required to complete an online travel and health declaration form before they were permitted to return to college to collect their results. They were also given the option of viewing their results online.

Additionally, the college implemented safety measures such as temperature screening (with stations both at the college’s main gate and foyer) and social distancing. The Class of 2018 received their results in separate classrooms, while our current JC2 students were dismissed from college earlier, and allowed to view their 2019 GCE A Level Mother Tongue Examination results online. A staggered dismissal timing system was also adopted to disperse all students from college earlier, increase social distancing and reduce the mingling of current students in large groups. The smooth implementation of these measures was possible thanks to the collaborative efforts of all JPJC staff and students, in a bid to allow college life to go on normally, but safely.

The Covid-19 situation did nothing to dampen the excitement and anticipation of the Class of 2018 and all JPJC staff, about the results release. The efforts and hard work of all our students and teachers have paid off, with our first batch of JPJC students obtaining commendable results. When asked about his thoughts regarding the performance of JPJC’s first batch of students, our Principal, Dr. Hang Kim Hoo, said, ‘I am certainly very pleased with the results of our first batch of JPJC students. It is heartwarming that our teachers’ care and support have brought about very positive outcomes for this cohort of students.’

To all our JPJC teachers and staff, a big thank you for supporting our students in their learning and development, and enabling them to achieve such positive outcomes! To the Class of 2018, congratulations, and we wish you all the best as you embark on a new journey ahead of you!
