Jurong Pioneer Junior College ushered in the Chinese New Year with much excitement and high hopes for a prosperous new decade.  Aptly themed ‘A Prosperous Decade’, the celebrations were a smorgasbord of cultural performances by the Symphonic Band, Chinese Orchestra, Guitar Ensemble, Malay Cultural Society, Indian Cultural Society and JP Dance Club. Besides these performances, a Quiz segment was included, testing students on their knowledge of Chinese culture and traditions. Furthermore, both students and staff got the opportunity to try their hand at Chinese knotting, an ancient Chinese art form. Both of these segments were fun-filled and extremely well-received by the audience. The celebrations ended on a high note with a much-anticipated performance by teachers. As teachers from various departments led the college in a sing-along session, the God of Fortune made an appearance, heralding not only a good year for JPJC, but also a favourable decade to look forward to.</p>
