Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) Matriculation and Orientation 2020 took place from 5 th to 12 th February 2020, for the college’s second batch of students. The theme this year was Orion, which served to remind our freshmen to chart and pursue their goals on their new journey in the college, as ancient seafarers charted their routes with the stars as their guide as they embarked on every new journey across the oceans. This event saw 222 Student Councillors (SCs) and Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) involved as it is the largest event under the purview of the Student Council and our student leaders, and one of the most important milestones of every freshman’s journey. Planned as an introductory programme for the incoming freshmen, Matriculation and Orientation 2020 introduced them to various aspects of JC life.</p>

During Matriculation and Orientation 2020, the freshmen spent time to get to know their seniors and teachers through bonding sessions. Through the Amazing Race, the freshmen participated in solving riddles and challenges while familiarising themselves with the new school environment. There was never a dull moment as the new students were engaged in various games to increase their awareness of the college values and leadership competencies. During the dance and cheer sessions, the freshmen learnt two dances unique to JPJC, as well as respective house cheers. On the last day of Orientation, the SCs and OGLs performed their much-rehearsed dances for the freshmen. The finale ended on a high note as freshmen cheered together as one as the whole college gathered around the classroom blocks. Our Vice-principal, Ms Yeo Siok Ee, gave a stirring speech to encourage our freshmen to look forward to the exciting journey ahead in JPJC as Orientation 2020 came to a close.</p>
