### **Staff Learning Days**
Staff Learning Days – when teachers gain insights into current trends!

Each year, time is set aside to update staff on latest pedagogies and allow them time to reflect on how these updates can be incorporated into their daily teaching routines. The first session for 2020 was held on February 11 and 12. This year, the learning focused on two key areas of Skills Future for Educators – Supporting students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) and Differentiated Instruction (DI). These two areas were selected to sensitise teachers to the evolving and diverse learning needs of our students.

The first workshop, conducted by Ms. Clare Yip, W2 Cluster Educational Psychologist, and Ms. Lourdes Maria, Senior AED (LBS) focussed on Supporting High-Functioning students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Teachers learned more about ASD students through theories, sharing of experiences by the trainers and discussion of case studies. At the end of the session, teachers were equipped with the relevant knowledge, teaching approaches and strategies to support and manage SEN students in their classes and CCAs.

On the second day, the workshop on DI aimed to familiarise teachers with the principles and strategies of DI and the use of formative assessment to support differentiated approaches. The workshop was planned and delivered by a team of teacher leaders – Mr. Lester Lim (Lead Teacher, History), Mdm. Lim Meow Ang (Senior Teacher, Maths) and Mdm. Lin Kui Fong (Senior Teacher, General Paper). Complementing the team, Ms. Tang Swee Noi, an adjunct lecturer from NIE, was invited to the college to share her experiences and expertise in DI. She also guided teachers in creating differentiated lessons during the last part of the workshop.

All in all, it was a fruitful two days that the teachers spent at the Staff Learning Days 2020. Staff deepened their knowledge about the respective areas covered and took away insights that would enhance their teaching.
