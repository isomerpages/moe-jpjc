Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) held its annual Open House on 14 January 2020, welcoming over 1000 potential students to the college. Brimming with curiosity and excitement, our visitors were enlightened about college life, curriculum and assessment formats though the Academic and Subject Combination Showcase, where teachers were on hand to respond to visitorsâ€™ queries and provide invaluable advice. Our Principal, Dr. Hang Kim Hoo, also shared with our potential students and their parents the reasons why they should choose JPJC to embark on their junior college journey, citing the varied opportunities provided by the college for students to develop themselves holistically. Ministry of Education officers were also present to provide expert knowledge regarding the Chinese and Malay Language Elective Programmes, both of which were signature niche programmes here at JPJC. The Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Showcase also afforded visitors a clearer view of the holistic education and varied CCA programmes offered here at JPJC. Various performing arts CCAs put up entertaining and vibrant performances, showcasing their talents and providing visitors with a glimpse of how they can develop their interests and talents should they select JPJC as their college of choice. The energy and vibrancy of JPJC college life was truly palpable at Open House 2020, and it was an enriching experience for our visitors, and staff and students alike.</p>
