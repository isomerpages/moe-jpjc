In the light of the COVID-19 situation, Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) JC1 Post Examination Activities Day was conducted via virtual conferencing on October 5. The programme for the day comprised two segments, with concurrent Education and Career Guidance (ECG) sharing sessions in the morning, and an interest-directed enrichment segment in the afternoon.</p>

<p>
The ECG sharing sessions involved various JPJC alumni who are currently studying in the six local universities. Our alumni shared warmly with their juniors about their time in the college, tips on preparing for the Oral Presentation component of GCE ‘A’ Level Project Work, their undergraduate experiences, as well as the rationale for their choice of university courses. Our alumni also gave practical advice for university admission interviews. The JC1 cohort enjoyed the sessions and found it enriching. Notably, many students indicated that they now had a better understanding of university life, apart from gleaning useful information about the demands of various university courses. The ECG sharing sessions have indeed provided our students better clarity in terms of the type of courses they were keen to pursue in the future.</p>

<p>
In the afternoon, 131 students from the JC1 cohort participated in JPJC’s first-ever online Arts & Aesthetics workshops. The college’s Arts & Aesthetics committee put together five workshops with a range of art genres explored, from music to visual arts. Students were given the opportunity to try their hand at watercolour painting, batik art, manga drawing, pop song composition and electronic dance music composition. Even though the workshops were conducted online, the instructors were able to guide the students effectively through the use of high-tech cameras and online apps such as Bandlab. All workshops garnered positive feedback from the students and many expressed their gratitude at such a chance to unwind after their Year End Examinations and learn a desired skill. The students were also glad that the workshops helped to kick-start a new hobby and hone their creativity.</p>

<p>
The college also invited Science Centre Singapore to conduct two Physics workshops for our students. In ‘Fun with Optical Spectroscopy’, students get to build their own spectroscope, and use it to identify various elements through the light they emit. In ‘Fun with Electronics’, students learnt how to build various electronics devices, including a touch sensor.</p>

<p>
Last but not least, the Partnerships and Outreach Committee also organised an Alumni Speaker Series and invited three speakers - Mr Chio Wen Tian, Mr Gary Ong and Mr Jonathan Wong, all of whom are successful entrepreneurs in different industries. The theme of this series was ‘Entrepreneurship in the Design Field’. It was a candid session where all three speakers shared about their university and work experiences. All three speakers held a common belief about the importance of pursuing one’s interest and passion. This resonated strongly with the students, who expressed that they greatly enjoyed the sharing session.</p>

<p>
All in all, it was a fruitful Post Examination Activities Day for the JC1 cohort, and instead of dampening the atmosphere and mood, hosting the event on a virtual platform provided a refreshing take and a meaningful twist to the concept of lifelong learning and pursuing one’s interests, dreams and passions despite the challenges one may face.</p>
