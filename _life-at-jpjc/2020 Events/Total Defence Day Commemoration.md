<h4><strong>
	Covid-19 lends urgency to Total Defence Day Commemoration.</strong></h4>

<p>
The annual commemoration of Total Defence Day (TDD) took place in February in the midst of the global spread of COVID-19. With mass college activities cancelled to reduce possibility of spread, the TDD programme gave students the opportunity to reflect on how COVID-19 demonstrated the resilience of Singaporeans, and how we rallied together as a nation to combat this virus. In their TDD civics lesson, students actively shared their views on how our 6 pillars of Total Defence, including guarding against fake news about COVID-19, which comes under one of the pillars of total - digital defence, worked together to stabilise our society and prevent wide-spread panic and hysteria. In addition, TDD marked the commencement of a daily wipe-down routine to get students to clean the table surface after their meals in the school canteen, thereby promoting their sense of social responsibility and consideration towards others. More importantly, the occasion allowed students to think about the situation and develop fun and engaging positive advocacy messages to encourage the fight against COVID-19. Ranging from lovely hand-written cards to original witty short videos, our students sought to express their heart-felt gratitude towards the frontline personnel who risked their lives on a daily basis to keep Singapore functioning smoothly and safely during this period.</p>
