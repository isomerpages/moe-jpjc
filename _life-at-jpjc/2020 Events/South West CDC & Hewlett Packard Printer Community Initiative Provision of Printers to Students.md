### **South West CDC & Hewlett Packard Printer Community Initiative – Provision of Printers to Students of Jurong Pioneer Junior College**

As part of the South West Community Development Council’s (CDC) efforts to harness resources and work with corporates like Hewlett Packard (HP Inc) and contribute printers to students from less privileged families in the South West District, 27 Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) students have benefitted from this new initiative, receiving new printers to help them in their home-based learning. In light of the uncertainties and disruption to learning brought on by COVID-19, the donation of these printers has provided much-needed support for the learning needs of our students at home.

In commemoration of this meaningful initiative, a photo-taking ceremony was held in college on 15 June. Gracing the occasion were Ms Low Yen Ling, Mayor, South West District and Ms Vivian Chua, Managing Director of HP Inc, as well as Ms Yong Puay Khim, General Manager, South West CDC and Mr Lionel Chng, Chief of Staff to the Managing Director of HP Inc. Together with our Principal Dr Hang Kim Hoo and Vice Principals Mr Chua Kah Sheng, Ms Yeo Siok Ee and Mr Phua Yong Swee, Gurunathan Sampravinraj (20S01) and Sherlyn Thia Shi Lin (20S07) – two students who benefitted from the initiative – represented the college and thanked the South West CDC and HP Inc for their assistance and support.

In particular, Sampravinraj (Sam) was very grateful for the new printer he had received. “Printed notes are easier to write on and refer to during lectures, compared to toggling between the lecture video and lecture notes on the computer. Being able to print notes at home has made it much easier for myself and my younger sister, who is in Secondary Two. My sister will be taking her promotion exams this year, so having the printer helps her in her studies as well. This is our family’s first printer and I am thankful for this gift from South West CDC and HP,” said Sam.

JPJC is grateful for the support afforded to our students by both the South West CDC and HP Inc. Through this community initiative, our students are able to keep learning and keep going together.
