### **Teachers’ Day Celebration**
The theme for Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) Teachers’ Day Celebration this year was ‘Freesia’. Just as red freesias symbolise love and passion, our teachers have demonstrated their love for us and passion for teaching throughout this especially challenging year. Just like flowers, all teachers possess unique traits and qualities that enable them to shine in their profession and calling.

In the light of the Covid-19 situation and the need for Safe Monitoring Measures (SMM), each class helmed the celebration for their respective Civics and Subject Tutors in assigned classroom venues. Class Managers (CMs), together with their Class Exco facilitated a host of exciting activities planned by JPJC’s 3rd Student Council. The celebration started with an opening video address by our Principal, Dr Hang Kim Hoo. Next, the CMs displayed creativity and great team work with their Class Excos as they played various bonding games with their Civics Tutors while observing safe distancing. The celebration also featured a video that provided a touching insight into the lives of a few teachers and their demanding daily routines. Appreciation videos from the different classes that thanked teachers for their hard work and effort were also played at appropriate junctures throughout the celebration. There was also a segment where Subject Tutors visited the classes they taught, to spend time and bond with them on this special day. Lastly, teachers voted by students for JPJC’s internal Teachers’ Day Awards received their certificates from Dr Hang at the end of the day.

Although the whole celebration was short and simple, it was a unique, memorable and meaningful one for the teachers at JPJC this year.
