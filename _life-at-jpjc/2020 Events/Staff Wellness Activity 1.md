On the 27th of February, the staff of Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) turned out in full force at 7.40am to participate in the college’s first Staff Wellness Activity of the year. Organised by the college’s Staff Wellness & Recognition Committee, this event comprised a variety of interest-based activities. These activities included a soap-making class, conducted by Chemistry Department representative and JPJC’s very own ‘Soap Master’, Miss Lim Mei Guei Susan, non-stop Cha Cha by Mathematics Department representative and JPJC’s very own Cha Cha Queen, Madam Esther Leow, and the art of calligraphy by JPJC’s Play Art club students. Yet others chose to engage colleagues in mentally stimulating board games, in a session conducted by our English Language Department representatives Mr Billy Wooton and Mr Benjamin Tan. Staff who preferred physical activities opted either for a table tennis mini-clinic by Mother Tongue Languages Department representative Miss Li Hua, or a leisurely Park Connector walk by the ‘river’ that runs beside the college. The Physical Education Department also organised their very own cycling adventure to bond with each other, at the Park Connector. All in all, it was a morning well-spent for JPJC staff, in bonding and keeping fit.</p>
