The Orientation Group Leader Camp (OGLC) is an annual camp aimed at developing new Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) in preparation for Matriculation and Orientation 2020. In this three-day two-night camp, where OGLs are split into groups, a variety of learning opportunities were offered to them to enable them to step out of their comfort zones and develop themselves.</p>

<p>
	Some notable activities of the camp include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>House activities, where OGLs of the collegeâ€™s respective houses were separated into different groups. This facilitated the start of event planning, where OGLs worked together in coming up with house performances, designing symbolic house weapons, and creating house for Matriculation and Orientation. This has enabled them to develop efficient processes as a team, be more creative and have courage to step up and take initiative to lead others.</li>
		<li>Multiple team-building games, in which OGLs learn effective communication skills, and think creatively.</li>
		<li>Frequent debriefs and after-action reviews where OGLs were given the opportunities to be more forthcoming and to grow in confidence as they shared their views and opinions on processes and plans in preparation for Matriculation and Orientation.</li>
		<li>Solo Night, where OGLs spent an hour reflecting on their journey through OGLC, to consolidate what they have learnt.</li></ul>

<p>
With the guidance of the Student Council Teacher Advisors, the values of Integrity, Responsibility, Resilience, Respect and Compassion were reiterated and put into action by our OGLs. This way, the OGLs would be able to develop themselves and act as a good role models to their juniors in the upcoming Matriculation and Orientation 2020.</p>
