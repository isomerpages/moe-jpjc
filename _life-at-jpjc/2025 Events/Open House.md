<p>On the morning of 13 January 2025, the gates of JPJC were opened to the public, and streams of prospective students and their parents eagerly entered the school to attend the highly anticipated #whyJP Open House. Students were equally excited, keen to show off their school and activities. The Open House aimed to immerse visitors in the JPJC experience, allowing them to make informed decisions for the next chapter of their academic journey.

Upon entering, visitors were warmly welcomed at the registration table by our enthusiastic student leaders whose friendly smiles set the tone for an engaging day ahead. From there, they could choose their own adventure: join a guided tour to explore the campus, head to the hall to learn more about subject selection, or interact with students to discover the wide variety of co-curricular activities available at JPJC.</p>
