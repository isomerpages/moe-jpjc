<p>Before we wrapped up Term 2, JPFam came together on 27 May for an unforgettable Fitness Fiesta – a day packed with energy, excitement, and camaraderie! 🏃‍♂️💪💥</p>

<p>From heart-pumping fitness challenges to fun-filled games, students and staff united in the name of wellness, camaraderie, and friendly competition! 🤝🎯💃 The event was a fantastic showcase of holistic well-being and the strong bonds we share as a college. #infinitelove♥️</p>

<p>Huge shoutout to our passionate PE teachers and enthusiastic student volunteers who made it all possible! The air was filled with laughter, cheers, and team spirit – a true celebration of our vibrant JPFam community. 🔥🎉🙌</p>

<p>🏅 The Fiesta ended on a high with a prize presentation to honour the incredible efforts of teams who gave their all at the fitness stations, as well as a special award ceremony recognising our CCA students who represented JP in the National School Games and Inter-JC competitions! 🎖️🏆</p>

<p>What an exciting way to close the term!💫</p>
