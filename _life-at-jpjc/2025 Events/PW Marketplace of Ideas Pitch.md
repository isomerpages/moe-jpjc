<p>JPJC is proud to celebrate the achievements of our students at the inaugural A-Level Project Work (PW) Marketplace of Ideas Pitch, organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE) on <b>5th March 2025</b>. This prestigious event brought together A-Level students from various institutions, providing them with a platform to showcase their innovative solutions to address Singapore’s pressing challenges.</p>

<p>With the refreshed PW curriculum, students were encouraged to apply their classroom learning to real-world issues, strengthening their ability to think critically, collaborate effectively, and communicate confidently. The competition was judged by experts from the <b>Land Transport Authority (LTA), Singapore Food Agency (SFA), and National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre (NVPC)</b>, who evaluated the originality, feasibility, and impact of the proposed solutions.</p>

<p>JPJC students performed exceptionally well, with two teams securing <b>2nd and 3rd place</b> in the competition. Their strong performance is a testament to their creativity, perseverance, and ability to work as a team - skills that are essential for success in the 21st century.</p>
