<p>On 8 August 2025, the college commemorated Singapore’s 60th year of independence with a day of festivities that celebrated both heritage and unity. Dressed proudly in red and white, students and staff came together as one JPFam to mark this significant milestone in our nation’s journey. This year’s celebration featured the National Day Observance Ceremony, the National Day Carnival, and the eagerly awaited National Day Concert. The theme, ‘Building Our Singapore Together’, reminded all Singaporeans of the shared responsibility to safeguard our achievements and create a brighter tomorrow, hand in hand as a united people.</p>

<p>The commemorative spirit extended beyond the day itself, with pre-National Day engagement activities that captured the enthusiasm of the school community. A social media challenge invited every class to submit a photo showcasing the theme, and over 20 creative entries were received. The top three winners for each level were celebrated for their originality and school spirit. Adding to the excitement, students also staged a lunchtime concert in the canteen in the week leading up to the celebration, filling the campus with music and patriotic cheer. These initiatives, led by J1 CCE representatives under the leadership of Veerachamy Hiranmayi (25S08), brought vibrancy to the college and set the stage for the main event.

<p>Festivities on 8 August began with the National Day Observance Ceremony, where a contingent of students from various uniformed groups marched into the hall bearing the state flag. For the first time, House Representatives also joined the parade, symbolising the spirit of unity across the JPFam. The parade was led by Parade Commander Awratha Soe (25S13), Contingent Commander Supachai Sombat (25A03), and Second Contingent Commander Muhammad Izz Danish Bin Mohamed Khasman (25S05). The solemn flag-raising and recitation of the National Pledge reaffirmed our collective commitment to the nation’s ideals. This was followed by a screening of the 2025 National Day Message by our Education Minister, Mr Desmond Lee, and a heartfelt address by our Principal, Mr Kevin Ang, who reminded all present of the deeper significance of Singapore’s 60th birthday.</p>
