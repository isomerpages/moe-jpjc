<p><b>JPJC Students Embark on #InfiniteGrowth Day 2025: Learning Beyond Classroom</b></p>

<p>Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) held its annual <b>#InfiniteGrowth Day (IG Day)</b> on <b>9 October 2025</b>, a post-examination programme designed to promote learning beyond the classroom. The event encouraged students to explore new fields through a wide range of Learning Journeys and workshops spanning the <b>STEAM</b> and <b>Arts &amp; Aesthetics</b> domains.</p>
	
<p>IG Day was conceptualised to provide students with authentic learning experiences that develop curiosity and critical thinking. Teachers shared that the day served as “a timely opportunity for students to extend their learning after the examinations, while discovering how their classroom knowledge connects with real-world contexts.” Students signed up for various Learning Journeys based on their interests. They reported feeling excited to experience hands-on and industry-linked activities across Singapore.</p>
	
<p><b>Exploring Innovation and Industry</b></p>
	
<p>Students participating in the <b>STEAM-themed</b> journeys had opportunities to engage with cutting-edge technology and scientific applications. At <b>ExxonMobil</b>, they gained insights into the energy sector and learnt about sustainability efforts within one of the world’s largest companies. Participants in the <b>TI Rover Workshop</b> and <b>Drone Coding Workshop</b> explored programming, automation and robotics, while another group attending the <b>Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)</b> session deepened their understanding of solar technology and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>

<p>Those in the <b>Arts &amp; Aesthetics track</b> spent the day immersed in Singapore’s rich cultural landscape. At venues such as the <b>ArtScience Museum, National Museum of Singapore, Asian Civilisations Museum, and National Gallery Singapore</b>, participants gained a deeper appreciation of history, art and heritage. At the <b>Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum</b>, they appreciated the scientific efforts behind preserving natural heritage. A group visiting the <b>Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay</b> enjoyed a behind-the-scenes look at performance production, while others reflected on stories of human resilience at the Titanic Exhibition.</p>
