<p>On 8 and 9 October, we celebrated our J2s with a heartfelt and memorable send-off. After a year of co-designing their ideal farewell experience, the cohort enjoyed a meaningful farewell assembly before ending their final day together at Universal Studios Singapore (USS). The weather held up beautifully, and the memories created will stay with them for years to come.</p>

<p>As part of tradition, each graduating batch leaves behind a legacy item that captures their journey in JPJC. Inspired by their Orientation theme, <a href="https://www.jpjc.moe.edu.sg/cohort-identity/"><i>Mirage</i></a>, the Class Managers—together with the Year Heads and their classmates—co-created an interactive artwork that engages both sight and sound. This piece, crafted by Class Managers from 24A02 and 24S15, changes as you view it from different angles, symbolising the diverse hopes, perspectives, and heartfelt wishes the cohort has for one another.</p>

<p>Celebrations continued at USS, where the J2s soaked in the vibrant atmosphere, visited various attractions and presentations, and simply enjoyed being together one last time as a cohort. Dressed up, full of laughter, and surrounded by friends, they filled the park with joy and energy. We hope that these moments—big and small—will become cherished memories they look back on fondly as they move on to the next exciting chapter of their lives beyond Jurong Pioneer Junior College.</p>
