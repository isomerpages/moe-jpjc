<p>On 16 July 2025, #JPFam came together in full colour and unity to celebrate Racial Harmony Day 2025 with the theme, Our People, Our Tapestry! 🎉🌏 ✨</p>

<p>To commemorate the event, there were booths featuring the diverse races in Singapore, alongside showcases of cultures from Southeast Asia and East Asia —including Burmese, Thai, Japanese and Korean. Our five Houses also added to the buzz with their own activity-packed booths promoting racial harmony. Dressed in traditional wear, #JPFam joined in the games and activities, took photos, and celebrated what makes us uniquely united. We also hosted students and teachers from Teck Whye Primary School! 🤩🎊</p>
	
<p>Heartfelt thanks to the Community Engagement Council and our Student Council for their leading role in planning and carrying out such an incredible event! We would also like to thank photographers from the JP Media Tech Club, who captured the priceless moments.❤️‍🔥💯</p>
