<p>The ‘Xin Kong Xia’ (XKX) National Schools Xinyao Festival has returned for its 11th edition! This annual celebration of student-driven music continues to be jointly organised by our college, in collaboration with the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), TCR Music Station, and Lianhe Zaobao since its inception in 2015. This year’s festival was inaugurated with the Xin Kong Xia 2025 Press Conference &amp; Song Compilation Launch, held at our college on 14 March 2025. The Guest of Honour was Ms. Gan Siow Huang, Minister of State for MOE &amp; MOM, and Chairman of CPCLL.</p>

<p>The launch event was followed by the Xinyao Music Appreciation Session, marking the official commencement of this year’s festival. Attendees were treated to a showcase of past winning compositions, alongside classic Xinyao melodies, immersing them in the cultural and emotional depth of the genre.</p>

<p>A moment of immense pride for our college came when the music video for Yuki Leong Yu Zhen’s (24S10) original composition, ‘They Say’ (他们说), was officially launched during the event. The song, which won the Champion title in the Song Writing (Open) category of last year’s competition, was played for the audience, featuring both Yuki and Trisha Lim Ying Xuan (24A02). Their participation in the music video added a personal touch to the performance, and the audience warmly received the song’s heartfelt message.</p>

<p>Furthermore, two other outstanding student compositions—Treasa Tay Nyi’s (24A07) ‘Run!’ (肆意奔跑), which secured 2nd runner-up, and Ryan Tan Kun Jie’s (24S23) ‘All This Way’ (这一路走来), a Merit Award recipient—have also been professionally recorded and uploaded on the CPCLL YouTube page for wider appreciation.</p>

<p>In closing, the event reinforced the power of Xinyao as a meaningful conduit for students to express themselves through the Chinese language. By composing and performing these heartfelt pieces, our young musicians continue to bridge the gap between language learning and artistic expression, ensuring that Xinyao remains a vibrant and evolving part of Singapore’s cultural heritage.</p>
