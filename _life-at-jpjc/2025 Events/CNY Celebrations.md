<p>The Chinese New Year (CNY) celebrations in JPJC have always been occasions of joy and happiness among students and staff. This year was no exception. 2025 is the year of the wooden snake, which symbolises growth, creativity and adaptability. The celebrations was a good start for another great year for JPFam, as we continue our journey of #infinitegrowth, #infinitelove and #infinitepossibilities!</p>
	
<p>This year’s celebrations began with a classic favourite: The Lion Dance. During the performance, the lively beat of the drums filled the air as the vibrant performers leaped and twirled, their colourful costumes shimmered under the festive lights. The lion’s graceful movements, synchronised with the rhythmic clashing of cymbals, created an electrifying atmosphere of excitement and good fortune. As the dancers hopped and swayed, the crowd’s laughter and applause blended seamlessly with the music, filling the college Hall with a sense of unity and bonding. School leaders were also invited on stage to join the Lion Dance celebrations and our Principal, Mr Ang, gave his well wishes to the JPFam.</p>
	
<p>As showing gratitude is an important part of the CNY traditions, the organising committee arranged a special treat for teachers, staff and the Operations Support Officers (OSOs). With CNY music playing in the background, class managers and student councillors presented mandarin oranges to them. The OSOs were also later invited on stage to receive goodie bags, which were put together by the Community Engagement Council (CEC) and the college’s Staff Welfare Committee (SWC) with the generous donations given by JPFam!</p>

<p>How much do the students know about Chinese culture? Students from the college’s 19th Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) Committee prepared an exciting and fun programme item of Chinese New Year Cultural quiz, which put students’ knowledge to the test on three topics, namely the Lion Dance, the festivities and customs, and Lo-hei. Students eagerly came up on stage to participate in the quiz session and all answers were accompanied with explanations, and even videos to further illustrate. Through interactive and engaging quiz activities, students not only reviewed and deepened their understanding of existing knowledge but also enhanced their sense of cultural identity. This approach provides non-Chinese students with an opportunity to learn more about Chinese culture, helping to break down cultural barriers and promoting understanding and communication between different cultures.</p>
	
<p>Vibrant music is also another special part of CNY celebrations. It symbolises the joy and hope as we welcome a brand-new year. Hence, the Chinese Orchestra performed the ‘Celebrating the New Year Suite’, which is a combination and adaptation of several songs that are often performed during the Chinese New Year celebrations to enhance the joyous and festive mood. With the strong rhythm and cheerful melody, the music piece brought us hopes for a new year and vigour of a festival. The Concert Band also presented two pieces that embody the spirit of the season. The piece ‘Red Wing’ from the composition Wing Colours by Yosuke Fukuda captured the fiery energy of youthfulness, symbolising passion, vitality, and the boundless possibilities that come with embracing life to the fullest, while the ‘Awakening Earth in Spring’ reflected the rejuvenation of spring, reminding us that just as nature awakens, we too can renew our spirits and aspirations.</p>
	
<p>The JP Dance Club contributed a captivating dance performance, celebrating the vibrant spirit of unity and collaboration as we usher in the Chinese New Year. Showcasing seamless synchronisation, the performance highlighted the strength found in harmony and togetherness. With 23 performers moving in perfect coordination, this extended choreography reflected the collective energy of our community, symbolising prosperity, good fortune, and the enduring values that bind us as one. The finale performance was brought to us by the Choir members led by Zoe from 24A02. They performed two songs, ‘From the Start’ and ‘Celebrating the New Year’. The first song is a reflective piece about expressing our true emotions, embodying the Snake’s wisdom and courage to be authentic. The second song captures the excitement of ushering in the Chinese New Year, celebrating family reunions, unity, and the hope for a peaceful and joyful year ahead.</p>

<p>After the performances, all students and staff were invited to the Canteen for a Lo Hei session. The air was filled with laughter and excitement as everyone gathered around the table, tossing the vibrant ingredients of Lo Hei high into the air. With each toss, wishes for prosperity and good fortune are shared, creating a joyful and festive atmosphere that brings everyone closer together in our JPFam.</p>
