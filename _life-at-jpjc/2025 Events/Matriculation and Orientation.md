<p>Matriculation and Orientation 2025 at Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) marked the beginning of an exciting and transformative journey for the incoming JC1 cohort. Designed to ease students into college life, foster meaningful connections, and instill a strong sense of belonging, the six-day programme embraced the theme ‘Infinite’—a reflection of the limitless possibilities ahead and the shared journey of the JPFam.</p>

<p>JC1 students were warmly welcomed into their new academic environment, starting with their Matriculation Groups before transitioning into their Orientation Groups. They were introduced to their Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs), who played a pivotal role in guiding and supporting them throughout the six-day experience. The Principal’s Address set an inspiring tone at the start of the matriculation programme, encouraging students to embrace new opportunities and challenges with confidence. Subject talks and booths provided valuable insights into various academic pathways, equipping students with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about their studies. Talks by the Year Head and School Counsellors offered guidance on personal growth and well-being, reinforcing the importance of resilience and self-discovery. Students were also introduced to JPJC’s Talent &amp; Leadership Development, STEAM, and Internationalisation programmes, which showcased the diverse opportunities available for them to explore their interests beyond the classroom.</p>

<p>The Orientation experience extended far beyond academics, immersing students in the vibrant and dynamic college community. The CCA Fair allowed them to interact with their JC2 seniors and discover the wide array of co-curricular activities available, helping them make meaningful choices that align with their passions. House bonding sessions, interactive games, and college dance sessions fostered camaraderie, school spirit, and friendships that would last well beyond Orientation. A key highlight was House Bonding Day, held alongside Orientation Day 3, where JC1s and JC2s came together to build connections within their Houses and classes, strengthening their collective identity and sense of belonging.</p>
