<p>🎉 On 18 July 2025, we celebrated our 7th College Day with the theme “Celebrating Our Journey, Crossing New Frontiers.” The event was a heartwarming reflection of our shared milestones and a call to continue pushing boundaries together as one united JPFam. ✨</p>

<p>We were deeply honoured to welcome Ms Jenny Koh, Group Chief Operating Officer / Executive Director of Matsushita Greatwall Corporation Pte Ltd, as our Guest of Honour. In her inspiring address, she shared her leadership journey in both corporate and community spheres, reminding us that the world doesn’t just need professionals, but people who lead with purpose, humility, and heart. 💬💖</p>

<p>Principal Mr Ang shared how the past year has been a transformative one where our students exemplified servant leadership through peer-led workshops, community outreach, and remarkable achievements in academics, sports, the arts, and innovation. Their success in the 2024 A-Level Examinations is a testament to JPJC’s holistic approach to education. He also highlighted how strengthened partnerships, tech-integrated learning, and the expansion of our JP Global Experience programme have created richer learning opportunities for all. 👏🌍</p>

<p>A big congratulations to Tan Jia Rui, our 2024 Valedictorian of the Year, who exemplifies excellence, leadership, and compassion. His unwavering dedication to growth, both academic and personal, truly embodies the spirit of JPJC. 🌟🚀📚</p>
