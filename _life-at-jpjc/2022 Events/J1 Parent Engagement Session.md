On 25 February 2022, Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) organised the J1 Parent Engagement Session, a virtual meeting with the parents of our new J1 students, that saw an excellent turnout with enthusiastic participation from all parents.</p>

<p>
The session began with our Principal, Dr Hang Kim Hoo, welcoming the parents and introducing the college’s key personnel. Our Vice-Principal (Education), Ms Yeo Siok Ee, then shared with parents some Curriculum and Co-Curriculum programmes provided by the college. With this year’s key focus, "Enriching Teaching and Learning through Blended Learning and Support System”, Ms Yeo elaborated on how students’ learning processes are designed in JPJC. Ms Yeo also spent some time enlightening parents about the rigour of the ‘A’ Level syllabus and the J1 Assessment Policy & Promotion Criteria, which was a point of concern for many of the parents as evident from the pre-event questions gathered.</p>

In the next part of the webinar, our J1 Year Head, Mr Subash Ramiah shared information on the college calendar and assessment milestones. Mr Subash went on to provide pertinent details about the Tiered Support System that JPJC applies to provide more catered facilitation to various targeted students’ needs.  Mr Subash also explained to parents about the newly implemented Self-Directed Learning Afternoon (SDLA) slots, which is a time for students to do asynchronous learning that has been incorporated into students’ timetable. He highlighted that SDLA was aimed at facilitating students in developing their ability to be self-directed learners.</p>
