<p>The college’s JC1 Dialogue session with our distinguished speaker took place on 25 May 2022 against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Singapore’s decision to impose unilateral sanctions on Russia. In this context, the presence of Ambassador (retired) Lawrence Anderson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at our college was timely as he reminded our students of Singapore’s vulnerability in a world where the law of the jungle continues to prevail, notwithstanding the existence of international laws and global institutions such as the United Nations. Ambassador Anderson highlighted the 5 key principles of Singapore’s foreign policy, such as being a friend to all and enemy to none, and our government’s consistency in strictly adhering to these principles since our independence in 1965, which helped to ensure Singapore’s successful navigation through the volatile Cold War and post-Cold War periods. The question-and-answer segment proved to be a highly interactive affair, with students demonstrating their interest in a potential diplomatic career and posing challenging questions to Ambassador Anderson, such as Singapore’s possible response in the event of an outbreak of war over the Taiwan/Republic of China issue. The session ended with our Principal Dr Hang presenting our college’s token of appreciation to Ambassador Anderson.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/jc1%20perspective%20engagement%201.jpg"></div><p>Ambassador Anderson giving a presentation on the key principles of Singapore’s foreign policy.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/jc1%20perspective%20engagement%202.jpg"></div><p>Ambassador Anderson during the Q&amp;A segment with CEC President Kong Yan Heng (22S17) as the student moderator.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/jc1%20perspective%20engagement%203.jpg"></div><p>Dr Hang presenting a token of appreciation to Ambassador Anderson on behalf of the college.</p>
