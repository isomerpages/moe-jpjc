### **OGL Camp**
JPJC’s annual Orientation Group Leader’s Camp (OGLC), which was held from 5 to 7 January 2022, was designed to develop our Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) to take charge and lead in the upcoming Matriculation and Orientation (M&O) 2022. During the three-day camp, our OGLs were split into groups within their houses. This allowed for OGLs to step out of their comfort zones and work closely with their peers to complete a variety of activities.

Some memorable events of this year’s OGLC included:

- The Amazing Race, which provided an opportunity for OGLs within the same house to rally together and partake in various games, with the aim of accumulating as many points as possible. Through this, OGLs not only forged strong bonds with one other, but also developed a stronger House spirit.

- The Communication and Managing Difficult Persons Workshop, which prepared OGLs for various unexpected scenarios that might occur during M&O. The OGLs familiarised themselves with possible scenarios and brainstormed for solutions, so that they could support the incoming JC1s in M&O 2022.

- Regular debriefs where OGLs consolidated and reflected on what they had done well, as well as possible areas of improvement. During this time, OGLs also went beyond their comfort zones and shared openly their learning experiences with others.

-  Team-building games where OGLs learnt to communicate effectively and work seamlessly in teams.

Under the guidance of the Student Council Teacher Advisors, this year’s OGLC provided an effective platform for building both leadership competencies and strength of character in students.

Through this camp, the OGLs have grown, and it is our hope that they will now be effective leaders and positive role models for their juniors in the upcoming M&O 2022.
