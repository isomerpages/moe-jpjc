On Saturday, 8 January 2022, two teams of Computing students represented Jurong Pioneer Junior College at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) Computing Challenge 2022.</p>

<p>
Our students took up the challenge of learning a completely new programming language, and engineered a minibot to navigate three challenging obstacle tracks. Despite a tough competition, one of our teams (Team Quartet) rose to the occasion and emerged as 2ndÂ runners-up in the event!</p>
