### **NTU SCSE Computing Challenge**
On Saturday, 8 January 2022, two teams of Computing students represented Jurong Pioneer Junior College at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) Computing Challenge 2022.

Our students took up the challenge of learning a completely new programming language, and engineered a minibot to navigate three challenging obstacle tracks. Despite a tough competition, one of our teams (Team Quartet) rose to the occasion and emerged as 2ndÂ runners-up in the event!
