<p>Everyone waited with bated breath amidst a waning pandemic, and finally, the day arrived. On 3 August 2022, JPJC held its Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Day in the college after a two-year hiatus from holding a physical fair due to the pandemic. It was last held in 2019 before the pandemic started a year later. On that afternoon, the whole school enjoyed a wonderful time at the fair.</p>

<p>Students, under the careful guidance of their teachers from the Biology, Chemistry, Computing, Mathematics and Physics departments, designed and managed the booths to showcase how Mathematics and Science can be applied in real-life through interesting demonstrations and hands-on activities.</p>
	
<p><b>Chemistry</b></p>
<p>
Cool, COCO-nut flavoured ice-cream and boba pearls on a hot afternoon? These were the treats the chemistry booths offered! Through this method, students understood how cooking involves chemistry.  Slime-making, candle flame magic and muscle flexing were among the other exciting activities the Chemistry students presented to their booth participants.</p>

<p><b>Computing</b></p>
<p>
Intrigued with how robots work? Participants got a chance to see our Computing students’ award-winning AI robots (built with Raspberry Pi and mBot) navigate through mazes and recognize shapes. Next, get ready to step into an immersive experience of an escape room that will invoke your five senses. Presented by our student winners from the BrainHack ‘Today I Learned – AI’ hackathon, participants immersed themselves in this real-life mystery game that enabled them to feel like real characters in this themed environment. Participants had to discover hidden clues, solve riddles and puzzles, and interact with AI to connect the missing links of the mystery. At another booth, student winners of the Microsoft Imagine Cup Junior also shared with participants their innovative proposed “AI for Earth” device for clearing plastic waste. Participants got a glimpse into the world of cybersecurity as our students shared some of the mind-blowing ways hackers can attack our computers and servers. Participants also attended a workshop to learn how to create their very own website using HTML and CSS.</p>

<p><b>Physics</b></p>
<p>
Participants had a chance to get up close and personal with a telescope that can read a tiny note pasted across the parade square, and the Physics students also showed their participants how to build their own telescope. The interesting physics behind 3D glasses is explained at yet another booth. Next, the fun of playing with a weird non-Newtonian substance that flows yet hardens when pressure is applied brought sheer delight to those at that booth. Another interesting offering was a workshop on how to build a battery-powered Tesla Coil, where the wonders of electricity could be witnessed.</p>

<p><b>Biology</b></p>
<p>
Biology students engaged their participants at their booths in interesting hands-on activities such as DNA extraction, food dye and milk experiments, and cooking an egg with no heat. There was also a station with fun-filled DIY testing for Vitamin C in fruits and vegetables, and another with puzzle games such as jigsaw pieces of the RNA of a coronavirus, as well as crossword puzzles with Biology terms.</p>

<p><b>Mathematics</b></p>
<p>
Mathematics students treated the participants to an intriguing Monty Hall problem game show. Other stations saw participants entering the dimension of optical illusion through 3D holographic projections, engaging in intriguing six-cards game where the student facilitator could magically guess the participants’ chosen numbers, and immersing themselves in the wonderful world of Nim and Sudoku games!</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>
To top it off, there was a game card for every group of students to collect stamps from the booths they had visited, which they dropped into a lucky draw box at the end of the event to win prizes. And there was also a Best Decorated Booth contest to commend the most outstanding booth of each department.</p>

<p>STEM Day was an absolutely fun day for all participants, as well as for the students managing the booths to interact with their peers to spread their passion in the subject and their joy of learning. The STEM Day 2022 experience was a true demonstration of the college motto, While I Live, I Learn, <em>Plus Ultra.</em></p>
