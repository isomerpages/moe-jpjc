<p>On 3 August 2022, the Arts and Social Sciences Interest Programme (ASSIP) group hosted the annual Arts and Social Sciences Day. Organised by the teachers-in-charge and JC1 members of the interest programme, it was aimed at creating greater awareness and appreciation for the arts and social sciences.</p>

<p>This year, the event was held physically at the concourse alongside the STEM booths. With ‘Connectedness’ as the theme, the J1 ASSIP students worked meticulously to set up booths to share about the topics they conducted research on. Connections were also made to their personal interests and passion in the arts and social sciences with the goal to pique the interest of the general student population.</p>

<p>There was lively participation in and exploration of the various interactive elements across the five booths: adding of songs to the ASSIP Spotify playlist, balloting on whether western culture affects Singaporean youths, polling for the characters in zombie movies which would have more chances of surviving, reflecting on whether social media has positively or negatively impacted their own lives, as well as throwing hoops on the correct cones with the answer at the e-commerce booth. Through these activities, students obtained simple treats and also thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was an equally enriching experience for the students of the ASSIP as they learnt to facilitate interactive activities and step out of their comfort zones to engage their schoolmates and teachers.</p>
