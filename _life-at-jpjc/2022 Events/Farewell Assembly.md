<p>Farewell Assembly is a very special occasion held annually for our JC2 students. The event marks the culmination of their hard work and the acknowledgement of just how far they have come since they first entered JPJC as excited yet anxious students fresh out of secondary school.</p>

<p>This year, the Farewell Assembly which was held on 7 October 2022, began with a class party in the homerooms where students bonded over food and made their own mortarboards. After the class party, students made their way to the Hall for the concert where they were entertained by The Unknowns (the college’s very own band consisting of teachers from various departments) and a song performance by JP Spotlight contestant, Reyes Jara Chelsea. In addition, students were delighted when they saw their teachers acting and dancing in two music videos, dedicated to the cohort.</p>

<p>As a farewell gift for the JC2 cohort, our Principal, Dr Hang Kim Hoo, presented an elaborate patchwork quilt made by all staff and teachers of JPJC to Herwin Manivannan, President of the 4th Student Council. The quilt, also known as 百纳被 in Chinese, symbolises the bountiful blessings from JPJC staff to all JC2 students.</p>

<p>At the end of the concert, students threw their mortarboards in the air after singing the College Anthem for one last time as a cohort. As our JC2s officially graduate and leave the gates of JPJC, may they remember the encouraging words of Dr Hang in his farewell speech to the cohort – to always rise up high because there is no limit in the sky and to brave the odds and blaze the trail that lies ahead of them.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the Class of 2022! May your years ahead continue to be characterised by our college values of Integrity, Responsibility, Resilience, Respect, and Compassion. </p>
