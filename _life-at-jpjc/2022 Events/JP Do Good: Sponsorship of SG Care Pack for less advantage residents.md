This August, the college came together and celebrated our National Day in a meaningful way. In support of Singapore’s National Day (ND) celebration campaign #DoGood 2022, in which Singaporeans are encouraged to pledge to causes and contribute back to the community over the 22 days (from 16 Jul to 6 August 2022) before National Day, our students and staff from GymFit and the National Education and Service Learning (NESL) Committee initiated a SG Care Pack donation drive in the college. The project aimed to collect and provide care packs comprising basic food necessities for 77 less privileged residents from Jurong Spring Estate. By sponsoring the SG Care Packs to these residents, we hoped to be able to lessen the burden of daily living expenses during this period.

With the approval and support of the college, student leaders from Gymfit sprung into action, publicising the event to the college and rallying their peers and teachers to sponsor SG Care Packs for this good cause. The project received overwhelming support from both students and staff in the college, and all 77 SG Care Packs were fully sponsored in no time.

Despite the light drizzle that occurred on the eve of 2nd August, the GymFit team was all smiles and ready to begin the SG Care Pack distribution drive. Upon our arrival, we were warmly welcomed by the Jurong Spring (JS) Cares team, and introduced to how they serve the less privileged residents in Jurong Spring Estate by looking for donors and sponsors to donate or supply daily essential items. 
		
Having learnt about the workings of JS Cares, our team then moved on to the actual distribution activity itself. Students had the opportunity to interact with residents and know more about their life stories. Some even helped elderly residents to carry their SG Care Packs back home. At the end of the event, our team had the honour of meeting with Mr Huang Wei Zhong Shawn, Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC. Mr Huang expressed his appreciation to our students for initiating this project, and the college for sponsoring the SG Care Packs. In his sharing with our team, Mr Huang imparted insightful leadership tips and affirmed them for their great effort. He also encouraged them to continue to serve the community in their own ways beyond this event.

It was indeed a fulfilling and enriching experience for our students and staff, and a meaningful way for the college to celebrate our 57th National Day by giving back to community. Stronger Together, Majulah!
