“Incandescence” was our theme for Teachers’ Day 2022! The theme was chosen as teachers are guiding lights, glowing like beacons to illuminate students' lives, inspiring hope while giving them a sense of direction.

Held on Thursday, 1 September, the Teachers’ Day Celebration was planned and executed by the 5th Student Council, in collaboration with all CCA Leaders. Before the classes assembled in the hall for the concert, students presented their Civics Tutors with specially crafted and customised lightsticks to express their appreciation and gratitude. Not only do the lightsticks represent teachers, they made an essential concert accessory so that teachers could wave and sing along during the performances!

The concert was a much-anticipated one as it was the first time both JC1 and JC2 cohorts gathered in the same venue since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The celebration kicked off with a video address by our Principal, Dr Hang Kim Hoo. Following the address were captivating performances by the Concert Band, JP Dance and JP Spotlight winners. The audience was also energized by trivia quizzes through which they learnt interesting facts about their teachers. Ending the celebration was the announcement of the winners of the Teachers’ Day Awards which were given out by the school leaders. These awards are a culmination of students’ appreciation for their teachers, and provide the chance for teachers to be recognised for what makes them unique!

The excitement shared by the entire college in commemorating this important occasion will surely remain a pleasant memory etched in all our hearts for a long time to come. Thank you, teachers, for your tireless efforts in helping us learn and grow – enjoy and bask in YOUR moment – and have a Happy Teachers’ Day!
