### **JPJC e-Open House**
Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s (JPJC) e-Open House was held on 13 January 2022, a day after the GCE O Level Examination Results Release. Our e-Open House provided prospective parents and students an insight into the college’s enriching programmes and school experience to help them make informed decisions about their choice of college to enroll in, and subjects to pursue.

On the day of our e-Open House, our Principal, Dr Hang Kim Hoo, kickstarted the day’s programme with a welcome address and presentation to participants, hosted via a Zoom Webinar. Dr Hang presented on JPJC’s quality education and shared about the college’s wide range of programmes and its vibrant student culture. Our Head of Department for Chemistry and Biology, Ms Eileen Toh, provided an overview of the JC Curriculum and subject combinations while our Vice-Principal, Ms Yeo Siok Ee, addressed questions submitted by participants.

Thereafter, JPJC’s Virtual College Tour was launched on the college’s various official social media platforms and website. Our Student Council President, Herwin A/L Manivannan, led viewers on an engaging virtual tour around the JPJC campus and shared how various spaces in the college are used to support learning programmes and activities. While the college was unable to accept visitors on campus given the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, the virtual tour allowed prospective students to immerse themselves within the school environment and experience what the college has to offer.

Subsequently, subject information-related sessions were helmed by our Heads of Department (HODs) on Zoom. There were also sharing sessions on JPJC’s niche programmes – namely, the Language Elective Programme and Talent & Leadership Development Programme. The afternoon programme provided a glimpse of the JPJC experience from the perspectives of parents, alumni and current students. Mdm Bee Hwee Fang, Chairperson of JPJC’s Parent Support Group, and Mr Loo Cheng Chuan, a parent and also an alumnus of the college spoke candidly about how they came to the decision of a suitable JC for their children. Our students, Diya Khanna, Faith Low, Andrew Sin and Jordan Teo shared about their rich learning experiences in the college and fielded questions from prospective students.

We look forward to welcoming JC1 students to the JPJC family and to join us on this journey of learning and innovation!

For prospective students who were unable to join us on e-Open House day, the college has put up recordings of all the webinar sessions on the college’s website.
