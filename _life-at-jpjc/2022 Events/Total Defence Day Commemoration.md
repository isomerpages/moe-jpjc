For this year’s Total Defence Day (TDD) Commemoration, the National Education and Service Learning (NESL) Committee put together a series of activities for both Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons as well as Student Development Experiences in the month of February, to remind students of the importance of the 6 pillars of Total Defence in safeguarding Singapore's long term security.</p>

<p>
The TDD commemorative programme began during the JC2 Enrichment Week with two concurrent National Education (NE) engagement sessions to showcase how each and every one of us could play a part in the aspects of military and civil defence in protecting Singapore. A virtual National Service (NS) engagement session with three JPJC alumni sharing their National Service experiences with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Civil Defence Force and Singapore Police Force, was conducted for JC2 boys serving NS after graduation. Concurrently, a separate virtual engagement session with the SAF Volunteer Corps was held for the rest of the JC2 students.</p>

<p>
During the CCE lessons, adopting a game-based approach, JC2 students took part in a virtual escape room game and reflected on the vital need to safeguard our digital security, which everyone has a role to play. In the post-lesson activity, each JC2 class also created an original Total Defence trail showcasing the 6 pillars of Total Defence in their chosen neighbourhoods in Singapore. Conceptualised by the Community Engagement Council, this project reminded students of the vital role each of us plays in defending Singapore.</p>

<p>
Our new JC1 cohort participated in an interactive Chingay NE School Assembly show, which involved the dramatic use of skits, songs, musical instruments and live facilitation. JC1 students gained further appreciation of the importance of preserving ethnic-religious harmony in Singapore as part of our social defence pillar.</p>

<p>
To conclude the TDD commemorative programme, our college also hosted a SGSecure Exhibition which served as a reminder of the vital role of all Singaporeans in doing our part to safeguard our country's security, as reiterated by the theme for TDD 2022, “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”.</p>
