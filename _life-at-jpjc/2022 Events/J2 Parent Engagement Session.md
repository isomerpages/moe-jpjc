The Parents’ Engagement session for JC2 parents was held on Friday, 28 January 2022. The virtual webinar hosted by JPJC’s School Leaders and Heads of Departments saw a good turnout with enthusiastic participation from the parents. The session focused on the school programmes and support made available for our graduating cohort.</p>

<p>
Our Vice-Principal, Mr Nah Hong Leong and the JC2 Year Head team comprising of Mr Koh Chit Siong and Ms Ong Huiwen shared with parents on the college’s approach to Blended Learning, which is aimed at developing students’ ability to be self-directed, passionate and life-long learners. In particular, the rationale behind the formulation of Self-directed Learning Afternoon (SDLA) in the structured time-table to support students in their consolidation of learning was featured.</p>

<p>
Parents also learnt about the college’s support structure for students’ well-being. Subject Head for Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Ms Valerie Tan, also shared on the resources for parents on future education options and admissions after graduation for this cohort of students.</p>

Finally, in a Q&A session helmed by the members of the School Management Committee, parents participated enthusiastically. It was an enriching session for all, and the college will continue to work closely with parents to foster greater home-school partnership in the holistic education of our students.</p>
