<p>JPJCâ€™s Literature Symposium, organised by the English Department and supported by the English Drama Society (EDS), was a fun and innovative way to learn more about literature, and cultivate a greater appreciation of the subject within the college. Through the many enthralling performances, the paper presentation and the experience of working backstage, both participants and audiences not only learnt more about the poetry and texts discussed but also developed a profound admiration for the intricacies that go into crafting such mesmerising artistic pieces. This was especially so for the EDS team, which was instrumental in ensuring that the event went smoothly.</p>
<p>
The poetry performances by the JC2 H2 Literature in English students allowed audiences to understand the use of sound and the power of words in depicting the human experience. The drama performance of Saint Joan by the JC1 H1 Literature in English students was mesmerising in its depiction of humour as well as poignancy in the journey of a young woman towards sainthood. And who could forget our very own Literature teachers taking on the role of authors and characters in the texts taught in the syllabus such as Plath, Pinter, Queen Gertrude and Joan. They delivered a rollicking performance under the guise of the said authors and characters. Overall, being a part of the Literature Symposium was a valuable experience filled with rich learning moments and all who were involved thoroughly enjoyed and benefitted from it. many enthralling performances, the paper presentation and the experience of working backstage, both participants and audiences not only learnt more about the poetry and texts discussed but also developed a profound admiration for the intricacies that go into crafting such mesmerising artistic pieces.
