<p>Owing to the relaxation of Safe Management Measures (SMM), the college was able to gather in larger numbers for part of the college’s celebration. Fittingly, this year’s National Day theme “Stronger Together, Majulah” is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as a united and strong people towards a better future.</p>

<p>This year’s programme was special because of the student empowerment and ownership in conceptualising, creating and conducting every aspect of the celebration, from the National Day Observation Ceremony to the CEC Gameshows, Class-based Celebration and Bonding activities and finally the mass sing-along segment of the celebration. To aid in creating a celebratory atmosphere, the National Education and Service Learning (NESL) Committee prepared a fun pack for each class comprising clappers, tattoo stickers, light sticks and Singapore flags.</p>

<p>The morning celebrations began with the National Day Observance Ceremony and the reading of the National Day message 2022 by our Education Minister, Mr. Chan Chun Sing, both of which were observed via Zoom. Following that, both JC1 and JC2 students took part in their own class bonding activities held in their respective homerooms. For the JC1s, student hosts from each class took the lead in conducting the virtual Heritage Food Trail conceptualised by the Community Engagement Community (CEC) aimed at reminding students of our multiculturalism and how food is crucial to Singapore’s national identity and a unifying cultural thread.  For the JC2s, the Citizenship Representatives from each class conducted the class bonding activities, followed by traditional games prepared by the NESL team, which aimed to build and strengthen class spirit and foster peer support.</p>

<p>For the second segment of the celebration, the JC2s gathered as a cohort in the hall, while the JC1s were split up and gathered in LT3 and LT4 respectively. This segment was hosted by selected CEC leaders who facilitated the gameshow and mass sing-along in the respective venues. This segment began with an exciting gameshow that highlighted features of our unique nation-state. This was followed by the playing of the well-wishes video montage by both students and staff expressing their appreciation for Singapore.</p>

<p>The celebrations concluded with the usual crowd favourite – the mass sing-along session – as the finale. For this segment, our House Exco Representatives, JP Choir and JP Spotlight created their very own music videos of popular National Day songs, and these were played alongside the live performances by student performers. The singing of “Home’ served as a rousing finale to our SG57 celebrations and brought much cheer to our college!</p>
