Each year, the college organises the Service Learning Festival (SL Fest) to provide a multi-faceted platform for our students to explore volunteering opportunities. This year, the SL Fest took place on 6 April with 5 concurrent sessions for both our JC1 and JC2 cohorts.</p>

<p>
Speakers from various social service organisations and community partners were invited to share with our students the needs of various groups in the community, and how they could contribute in the various areas of their passion and interests. The organisations who graced the occasion represented different service sectors, from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, The Food Bank Singapore, Family Central (Fei Yue Community Services), the Handicaps Welfare Association, Team Nila, the Ministry of Manpower, ItsRainingRaincoats and Heartware Network.</p>

<p>
This year, for the first time since the inception of SL Fest, the college also invited our alumni, as well as current students from the Eco Club, Chess Club and Interact Club respectively to share about their volunteering and project management experiences. Our alumni Mr Sheam Kannan and Mr Daryl Lee shared about their experiences serving as EXCO members in Jurong Spring Youth Network and Keat Hong Youth Network respectively. Ms Song Sing Suen shared about her past work experience as a Volunteer Management Executive in Beyond Social Services. Last but not least, Ms Ng Xin Yi shared about how she initiated a project to organise a virtual Chinese New Year-themed craft workshop to engage seniors online, in spite of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in 2021.</p>

<p>
In all, SL Fest 2022 was a platform that served to open our studentsâ€™ eyes to the rich and varied ways in which they could make a difference in society, in their own special ways. Our students have benefitted from the enriching sharing sessions, and are inspired to reach out to the community with a renewed sense of purpose!</p>
