In collaboration with Keat Hong Youth Network, our college organised the Leadership Training Camp 2022 for Secondary Two students from five secondary schools in the West Zone. These schools included Crest Secondary, Dunearn Secondary, Hillgrove Secondary, Nanyang Girls’ High and Unity Secondary. 47 students from the Scholars Development Programme planned and facilitated the camp activities as mentors. The aim was to impart leadership skills to camp participants and to provide a safe and enriching platform for youths with different backgrounds to come and learn together. </p>

<p>
Our Guest of Honour for the event was Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, Grassroots Adviser to Chua Chu Kang GRC GROs (Keat Hong), who gave the closing address and presented certificates of appreciation to participating schools. Teachers, camp facilitators and camp participants also had the opportunity to engage and interact with Mr Zhulkarnian.</p>

<p>
During the full-day camp, the camp participants engaged in station games, which exposed them to core leadership competencies including the crucial skill of ‘Enabling Others to Act.’ An Environmental Sustainability Workshop was also planned as part of the programme. The student planning committee and facilitators conceptualised and successfully actualised the Environmental Sustainability Workshop and the station games. Demonstrating a heart to serve, our student leaders have indeed ventured beyond the college to contribute to the larger community.</p>
