With the evolving education and career landscape today, it has become increasingly important that students clarify their career self-concepts and develop skills in gathering information on Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL). This is aligned with industry sentiments, as well as the Ministry of Education’s efforts in strengthening Education and Career Guidance (ECG) for students.</p>

<p>
At Jurong Pioneer Junior College, we encourage students to do the same in taking charge of their own further education and career trajectories through their active participation in ECG-related activities.  To cater to this, the college embarked on an Enrichment Programme which ran for six days from 7 to 14 February for J2 students not involved in JC1 Matriculation and Orientation 2022 as Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs). Students participated in programmes that allowed them to extend their learning experience beyond the classroom via virtual platforms.</p>

<p>
Students were treated to a diverse range of opportunities for learning through talks conducted by various IHL. Representatives and alumni from the six local autonomous universities shared enthusiastically about the programmes and experiences varsity life had to offer to prospective students. On top of talks offered by IHL, students also heard from industry experts about the media, climate change and government & statutory boards in a panel discussion format. In the aspect of General Paper, they had the privilege to learn about paradigm shifts in the pandemic age as well as Singapore’s efforts in making a green transition towards a sustainable development. Finally, alumni and SAF Volunteer Corps sharing on National Service provided students with insights of what life would be like after junior college. The OGLs were not forgotten while they served the college, as all these valuable sharing sessions were recorded and disseminated to them via the KM portal.</p>

It was a bountiful six days of learning and exposure for our J2 students as they discovered the exciting possibilities that await them. May this help them to chart their directions as they venture towards their goal to take them further and beyond!</p>
