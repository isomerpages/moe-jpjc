<p>College Day 2022 was held on two days – 22 July and 30 August – this year. Two separate ceremonies were held with the first being an award ceremony to honour the achievements of our students in the 2021 GCE A Level Examination, while the second celebrated the academic and Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) achievements of our current JC2 and JC1 cohorts. Both ceremonies were held face-to-face for the first time since the pandemic unlike the previous two years, when the event was commemorated with the launch of e-magazines. </p>

<p>The theme for this year’s College Day ‘Braving the Odds. Blazing the Trail’ aptly captured the essence of the celebrations. It also reflected the college’s journey in the past two years as the college overcame many changes and disruptions due to the pandemic. Despite changes in the modes of learning from physical classroom lessons to online Home-based Learning, both our students and staff showed resilience and adaptability and were able to rise to the occasion and achieve successes in the academic aspect and various fields. The highlights of the College Day included performances by the Symphonic Band, Chinese Orchestra, Choir, JP Dance Club and other performances beautifully put together in a video format. Guests also enjoyed a sumptuous dinner spread during the first ceremony as they watched the performances.</p>

<p>The College Day ended with the singing of the College Anthem led by the Choir and our teachers Mr Edwin Lim and Ms Alice Seah. College Day 2022 was indeed a joyous and memorable affair as the college celebrated the holistic achievements of our students together, at long last, after a hiatus of two years.</P>
