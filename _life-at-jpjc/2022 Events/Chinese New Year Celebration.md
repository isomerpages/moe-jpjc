### **Chinese New Year Celebration**
On the 31st of January, JPJC held a unique yet memorable Chinese New Year Celebration, with the theme ‘A New Beginning’ (万象更新). The objectives of the event were to celebrate the festive occasion as a big family, and provide an opportunity for one and all to practise self-regulation as the college prepares to welcome the Lunar New Year together.

The college organised several segments to provide students an opportunities to enact our college values. The highlight class spring cleaning. Through the initiative, students not only “got rid of the old” and spruced up the classrooms, but also used this opportunity to show our gratitude to the cleaners who have been keeping the college clean, which has been especially challenging in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Concurrently, students decorated and brightened up their classrooms using recycled materials. Students also actively participated in and collaborated on traditional Lunar New Year practices such as Chinese calligraphy writing and handicraft-making using red packets were conducted.

A unique addition this year was videos from the students. Each JC2 class submitted a greeting video to send their well-wishes to their peers and teachers.  Our performing arts groups, including Chinese Orchestra, Symphonic Band, Malay Cultural Society and Indian Dance also put up wonderful and energetic performances to celebrate the festive occasion. Teachers and students also enjoyed the Kahoot quiz, which both tested and broadened our knowledge about the commemoration of the Lunar New Year and cultural practices. Last but not least, as part of a Community Engagement Council initiative, the college presented goodie bags as tokens of appreciation to our cleaners.
