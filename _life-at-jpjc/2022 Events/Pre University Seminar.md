### **Pre-University Seminar**
Held at National Junior College, this year’s Pre-University Seminar involved 550 students from 30 local pre-university institutions. This year’s theme was ‘Service: Forging the Singapore Story.’ The theme, underpinned by the four narratives of Harmony, Kindness, Resilience and Innovation, was crucial in helping participants gain a deeper understanding of the true sense of service that has motivated various Singaporeans from diverse backgrounds to make contributions to their community and the nation.

Minister of Education Mr Chan Chun Sing was the Guest-of-Honour for the opening ceremony. In his address, he emphasised the need to be confident, curious and connected – three key qualities that Singaporean youths should embrace to face a more unpredictable world saddled with enormous challenges.

Prior to the seminar, the participants attended workshops where they engaged with academics, senior civil servants and other mentors to work on a group project. In addition, the participants took part in learning journeys around Singapore, as well as panel discussions and dialogues during the four-day seminar. The conversations and interactions throughout the seminar focused on Singapore’s development, identity and values in a rapidly changing world. The seminar culminated in an exhibition where the projects of the different groups were showcased.  Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth, and Trade and Industry, Mr Alvin Tan, graced the closing ceremony. All in all, student delegates from JPJC gained invaluable insights, connected with their peers and industry leaders, and broadened their horizons in this prestigious annual event well-known to be a highlight of a student’s pre-university education journey.
