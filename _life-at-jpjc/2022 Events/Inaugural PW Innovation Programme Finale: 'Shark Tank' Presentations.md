The finale of the college’s inaugural PW Innovation Programme took place on Friday, 25 March 2022, in the form of a ‘Shark Tank’-style presentation exercise, where four teams of JC2 students had to pitch their products to a panel. The event, which was held on campus, was the culmination of a programme that was officially launched on 24 November last year. The PW Innovation Programme was meant as a platform for interested students to extend and to hone their skills and knowledge acquired from PW for real-world application. To this end, our college entered into a partnership with Design Singapore Council (DSG) to launch this programme with a focus on Design Thinking (DT). Participants of the programme were trained by design experts from Design Exchange (DX). To provide a goal for the application of their training in DT, programme participants also took part in the SUTD x SIA Upcycling Challenge 2021/2022.</p>

At the finale, groups were given 15 minutes to present their products based on the aircraft parts they had previously chosen from a retired Singapore Airlines (SIA) aircraft fleet. The purpose of the competition was to inculcate the importance of upcycling as a means to reduce wastage of finite resources. Selections included life vests, safety belts and even a trash bin! Each team demonstrated much enthusiasm and creativity as they strived to convince the panelists – our Vice Principal Mr Phua Yong Swee and two trainers from DX – as to why their product would address the needs of the intended user while helping SIA to gain publicity.</p>

After the team presentation segment, the panelists had their share of fun asking questions regarding the participants’ project ideas. There was much spontaneity and passion as teams tried to defend the rationales for their designs. Mr Phua wrapped up the session with his evaluation of the product design presentations. He commended all four teams for their passion and creativity, and further encouraged them not to be afraid to make mistakes in a continuous quest for improvement and excellence. The programme ended with the presentation of certificates of participation to the four teams by representatives from DSG and DX, followed by the presentation of gifts of appreciation to our guests by our Vice Principal Mr Phua.</p>
