### **International Friendship Day Commemoration**
Our collegeâ€™s commemoration of International Friendship Day (IFD) 2022 took place in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia. Through an exploration of the situation in Ukraine, students learnt about the geopolitical tensions and vulnerabilities that small states face. A key learning point was the importance of standing firm in upholding international law and agreements while maintaining good relationships with other countries.
