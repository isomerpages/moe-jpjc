Arts Fest 2022 was a significant step up from its inaugural 2021 debut, and the festival line-up was conducted face-to-face over a period of two weeks. This yearâ€™s edition saw a myriad of activities that range across six different art forms - Dance, Music, Theatre, Literary Arts, Visual Arts and Digital Media.</p>

<p>
With the objectives of facilitating interest discovery through experiential learning while creating arts vibrancy within the college, the Arts & Aesthetics (A&A) Programme Committee put together the following selection: screening of digital performances by the A&A CCAs, lunchtime performances, film screening by Singapore International Film Festival as part of their Film Immersion Programme, A&A CCA exchange workshops, Arts workshops for staff wellness, and literary and visuals art exhibition.</p>

<p>
Additionally, students were empowered on different levels to be involved in publicising, organising, and executing festival programmes. For instance, two volunteers from every class served as ambassadors in screening the A&A digital performances in their respective homerooms, which definitely enlivened the college atmosphere in the morning. The A&A CCA and Art Unit students planned and conducted the workshops for their peers and teachers, leading the way in heightening awareness of the arts within our college community.</p>

<p>
The Arts truly have the ability to heal and connect people. May this be the start to many more years of arts literacy and vibrancy in JPJC.</p>
