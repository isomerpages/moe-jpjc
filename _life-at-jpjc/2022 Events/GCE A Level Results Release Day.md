On the 22nd of February, Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) welcomed the third batch of students back to college for the release of the 2021 GCE A Level Examination results, with Safe Management Measures in place in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Graduands were also given the option of viewing their results online.</p>

<p>
Measures such as an online health declaration, vaccination status verification and temperature screening were put in place, and the Class of 2020 received their results in separate classrooms. In an effort to reduce intermingling, a staggered dismissal timing system was also adopted to allow current JC1 and JC2 students to leave the college earlier. Our current JC2 students were also allowed to view their 2021 GCE A Level Mother Tongue Examination results online. The smooth implementation of these measures was possible thanks to the collaborative efforts of all JPJC staff and students.</p>

<p>
Such a situation did nothing to dampen the excitement and anticipation of the results release for the Class of 2020 and all JPJC staff. It was a heartwarming sight to see our returning graduands reuniting for this occasion. Our returning students were happy to meet their teachers and classmates – some of whom they had not seen for some time – and catch up with them. The Class of 2020 had to face and overcome many challenges throughout their two years in JC, and in preparing for their A Level examinations. In the words of our Principal, Dr. Hang Kim Hoo, “Overall, despite the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the cohort’s performance and efforts are commendable.” Moving forward, JPJC continues to be committed to equip all our students holistically, especially with self-management skills which are crucial in enabling them to take charge of their own learning, recognise gaps, seek help from their teachers and take action in a timely manner to accomplish their goals.</p>

<p>
To all our JPJC teachers and staff, a big thank you for your unwavering support and dedication to our students’ learning and development in the midst of great challenges last year. To the Class of 2020, our heartiest congratulations, and we wish you all the best as you embark a new chapter of your lives.</p>
