### **Matriculation & Orientation**
The annual Matriculation and Orientation (M&O) for our incoming JC1 students was held from 7 to 14 February 2022. This year’s theme, Elements, aimed to reflect the individuality of the JC1 students who, despite being new to the JP family, are all capable of great achievements when they work together as one. This was reinforced by the tagline “United as one, ever driven.”

As a key Student Council event involving 185 Student Councillors (SCs) and Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs), M&O 2022 served as an induction and rite of passage for all new JC1 students. In the course of M&O, the freshmen were given ample opportunities to learn about their new classmates and seniors through a series of bonding sessions and games.

Similar to last year, M&O 2022 was decentralised to observe Safe Management Measures (SMM). However, that did not stop the freshmen from having fun and learning more about the college under the guidance of the OGLs. The fun-filled activities not only gave both the JC1 freshmen and OGLS an opportunity to know one another better, but also allowed them to develop valuable qualities such as teamwork and resilience. The OGLs also honed their leadership and problem-solving skills throughout the 6 days of activities.

M&O 2022 ended with a grand finale which included the majestic House Corridor March as well as an opportunity for everyone to dance their hearts out with their classmates and OGLs. It was a truly energising end to the 6-day welcome before the JC1 students begin the academic phase of the year.
