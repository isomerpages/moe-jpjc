### **ECG Parents’ Evening**
The annual ECG (Further Education and Career Guidance) Parents’ Evening was held on Friday, 6 May 2022, through a Zoom Webinar session. This was an event specially organised for parents and comprised  presentations by each of our six local university partners (Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore University of Social Sciences, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore Management University, Nanyang Technological University and National University of Singapore). The session also included a Question and Answer segment where parents could ask questions directly to the university partners.

Parents also gained insights on the exciting experiences and vibrant university life via sharings by our own college alumni who had graduated or are currently enrolled in the various universities. The event also provided parents with an update on university admission requirements, as well as the new courses offered by our local universities in light of the changing higher education landscape. This would better equip them to engage their children in conversations on their higher education options.

Overall, the event was well-received, with close to 150 parents attending the virtual session. It was a fruitful and enriching session for parents as they gained insights on the latest developments in the higher education landscape and had the precious opportunity to have their questions answered by our speakers during the Question and Answer segment.
