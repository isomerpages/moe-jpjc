<p>After a two year hiatus, JPJCâ€™s annual Careers and Higher Education Day was held on 24 August 2022, Wednesday. During the event, JC1 students had the opportunity to learn more about potential careers through talks by various industry speakers. The industries included were Healthcare, Banking &amp; Finance, Engineering, Digital &amp; Social Media as well as Accounting which catered to the diverse interests and profiles of our student cohort. The question and answer segment at the end of the talks allowed students to glean more insights on the nature of different industries. At the same time, the JC2 students attended a panel discussion session with our six local university partners (NTU, NUS, SIT, SMU, SUSS and SUTD) in the hall. The various university representatives provided many useful insights on university admissions and answered the queries that students had on applying to local universities. </p>

<p>In addition, after the concurrent sessions, students had the chance to visit numerous information booths set up in the concourse by industry and higher education partners. This enabled them to find out more about the interesting career and higher education opportunities as well as scholarships available and interact in person with the industry and university representatives. The Careers and Higher Education Day proved to be an enriching experience for our students in preparing them for their next milestone after graduating from college.</p>
