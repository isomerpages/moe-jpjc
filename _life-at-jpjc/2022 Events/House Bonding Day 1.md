### **House Bonding Day 1**
House Bonding Day 1 was organised by the House Executive Committee (EXCO) on 2nd March for both the JC1 and JC2 classes. The objectives of the event were to foster class bonding and to build House spirit. House Bonding Day 1 consisted of two competitions â€“ House Mascot Portrait Challenge (HMPC) and Perfect 6 Mission (P6M).

For HMPC, each class created a 3D paper portrait resembling their House Mascot, and mounted the portrait onto the Homeroom noticeboard. Three photos of the portrait were submitted for competition. The judging criteria included focus (materials used; accessories), theme (alignment to House identity; originality) and aesthetics (style; elegance).

There were two activities in P6M. For each activity, classes had to gather 6 items that were similar in nature or linked to the six Houses. They had to do so in the fastest and most accurate manner. No movement out of the classroom was allowed and hence students had to be creative about how they were going to accomplish the task.

The top three JC1 and top three JC2 classes for each activity were awarded prizes. All the classes which were awarded prizes including the next three best performing classes in each category won points for their Houses.

It was indeed an exciting afternoon as there was much camaraderie and energy felt throughout the college as the cohort participated enthusiastically in completing the tasks!
