The college’s signature talent competition ‘JP Spotlight’, returned for its fourth edition in 2022. Preparation for the event started in early February with newly-recruited students from the Organising Committee. Under the guidance of the event’s Teacher Advisor Mr Oh Keng Yong, the team diligently planned and executed the event to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for all participants.</p>

<p>
JP Spotlight aims to provide a platform for students to showcase their talents to their schoolmates as well as to provide a rare opportunity for students to plan and run the event. After three days of audition, eight out of the twelve groups of participants successfully made it to the Finale, which was held on 9 March 2022 at the school hall and live-streamed to the school population via Zoom Webinar. Despite the lack of a live audience, the finalists eagerly showcased their talents in various art forms, ranging from playing the cello to performing a self-choreographed dance. In the end, Jara Chelsea from 22S07 was crowned the champion for her delightful rendition of “Traitor” by Olivia Rodrigo, while Khairyna Balqis from 22A01 was voted for the Audience’s Choice award for her cover of “Every Summertime” by NIKI. In the midst of the voting for Audience’s Choice, there was a special guest performance by teachers from the Chemistry Department, the first time where teachers were featured on JP Spotlight. The department wowed the students, as well as the staff, with their mind-blowing magic tricks.</p>

Overall, the event was well-received by both participants and audience alike with an overwhelming amount of participation comprising a total of 1016 responses from the voting, which was the highest number of responses ever received for Spotlight. In addition, the event received a lot of support on social media, gaining 1030 followers on its Instagram account. True to its motto – “Light up the stage, let your talents shine”, JP Spotlight served as a visible reminder of the tremendous potential of our students and how they would readily rise to the occasion when given a stage!</p>
