<p>   As part of the annual SG Perspectives Engagement programme, our college welcomed Mr Richard Grosse from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a Dialogue with the JC1 cohort on Wednesday, 24th May 2023. Mr Grosse’s presentation focused on the aims of Singapore’s foreign policy, and the means to achieve them. He shared about several career milestones during his time as a Foreign Service Officer in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the various challenges he faced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the student Q&amp;A session that followed, students posed questions about several geopolitical issues in the world today, such as the current Russia-Ukraine conflict, the ongoing superpower rivalry between The United States of America and China, and the challenges that Singapore will face in navigating these issues. Mr Grosse shared his candid opinions and insights, such as the importance of Singapore abiding by and championing a rules-based international order, and the need for Singapore to maintain its neutrality but cultivate relationships with all nations, even if they have competing interests.&nbsp; Overall, the JC1 SG Perspectives Dialogue session proved to be a highly engaging and thought-provoking Character and Citizenship Education learning experience for our JC1 students in 2023..</p>
