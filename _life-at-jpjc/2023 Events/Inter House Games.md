<center><h4>House Revelry: JPJC’s Annual Inter-House Games unleashes the spirit of competition and camaraderie</h4></center>

<p>
Jurong Pioneer Junior College's Inter-House Games (IHG) in Term 4 this year, brought together J1 students from the six houses - Volans, Taurus, Ursa, Aries, Aquila, and Pavo - for a spirited competition across different sports. This year’s IHG included more new and exciting games like archery and netball, while doing away with other games like team skipping and captain’s ball, which were included in last year's IHG.</p>

<p>
The games gave the J1s a chance to bond within their respective Houses, allowing them to mingle with peers outside of their classes. Each student was given the choice to participate in one game, allowing everyone to play a game they enjoy and affording everyone the chance to represent their Houses.</p>

<p>
One thing that stood out was the undeniable team spirit showed by all the Houses throughout the day. Although every player wanted to win for their House, everyone was respectful towards each other and showed kindness as well as excellent sportsmanship throughout the games.</p>

<p>
Everyone fought valiantly for the victory of their Houses, ultimately resulting in the winning of the games by Taurus, who managed to clinch 5 wins out of the 11 games. Following close behind was Volans, and Ursa coming in third.</p>
