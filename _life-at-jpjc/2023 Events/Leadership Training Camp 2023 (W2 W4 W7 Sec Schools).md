<p>Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) organised a Leadership Training Camp (LTC) 2023 on 17 March for Secondary Two students from eight secondary schools in the West Zone (Cluster W2, W4 &amp; W7). The schools involved were Bukit Batok, Bukit View, Commonwealth, Crest, Dunearn, Fuhua, Hillgrove and Swiss Cottage. 29 JPJC students in the Scholars Development Programme planned and facilitated the camp activities with the aim of imparting leadership skills to campers and providing a safe and enriching platform for youths from different backgrounds to come and learn together, under their mentorship.</p>

<p>During the space-themed one-day camp with all its activities conceptualised and implemented by the Student Planning Committee (SPC) and student facilitators (SFs) from JPJC, the campers participated in activities that provided exposure to a core leadership practice – ‘Enabling Others to Act’. Participants were divided into six groups and all six groups of campers created a visual diary of what being a leader means to them, completed jigsaw puzzles in a dimly-lit environment and created a planetarium. They also designed a group flag and completed six station games that put their teamwork, leadership and soft skills to the test in a dynamic real-life environment.</p>

<p>The Guest of Honour at the Closing Ceremony of LTC 2023 was Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, Grassroots Adviser to Chua Chu Kang GRC GROs (Keat Hong). Mr Zhulkarnain gave the closing address, after which he presented Certificates of Achievement to the SPC and SFs, Certificates of Appreciation to participating schools and Certificates of Participation to all campers. All students involved in the event had the privilege of engaging Mr Zhulkarnain on a diverse range of issues, and sharing with him their experiences from the camp. All in all, the JPJC SPC and SFs were instrumental in putting together a successful and enrichment LTC 2023. With their heart to serve, our student leaders have indeed ventured beyond the college to contribute to the wider community.</p>
