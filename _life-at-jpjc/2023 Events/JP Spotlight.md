<p>The college’s signature talent competition – JP Spotlight returned for its fifth edition in 2023. Preparation for the event started in early February with a team of newly-recruited students forming the Organising Committee. Under the guidance of their Teacher Advisor, Ms Ong Huiwen, the team diligently planned and executed the event to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for both participants, and the audience.</p>

<p>As a unique niche event of the college, JP Spotlight aims to provide a platform for students to showcase their talents to their schoolmates, while affording the opportunity for yet other students to helm a major event and develop their leadership and organisational skills. After three intense days of auditions, 8 out of 21 groups of participants successfully made it to the Finale, which was held on 8 March 2023 in the college Hall. The finalists eagerly showcased their talents in various art forms, ranging from playing the flute to performing a self-choreographed dance. In the end, ‘Iniudicatus’, a band consisting of Khairyna Balqis Binte Suzaini (23A06), M Ahilan (23A03), Muhammad Dani Mirza Bin Ahmad Affandi (22S21) and Chua Jia Jun (22S21) was crowned the champion for their engaging performance of “Still Into You” by Paramore, while Chong Jun Rong from 22A03 was voted for the Audience’s Choice award for his cover of “Arcade” on the flute by Duncan Lawrence.</p>

<p>Overall, the event was very well-received by both participants and audience alike with strong participation in the voting polls. A total of 2046 votes were cast – the highest number of responses ever received in the history of JP Spotlight. In addition, the event received a lot of support, gaining 830 followers on its Instagram account. True to its motto – “Light up the stage, let your talents shine”, JP Spotlight served as a visible reminder of the tremendous potential our students possess and how they can readily rise to the occasion when given a stage!.</p>
