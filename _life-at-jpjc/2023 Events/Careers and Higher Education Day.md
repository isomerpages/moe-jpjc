<p>JPJCâ€™s annual Career and Higher Education Day was held on the 23rd of August this year. During the first segment of the event, our JC1 cohort had the opportunity to hear from industry players from various fields, including healthcare and defence. Students gained valuable insights about their potential careers of choice through talks which catered to the diverse interests and profiles of the cohort. On the other hand, the JC2 cohort attended talks by our six local university partners (NTU, NUS, SIT, SMU, SUSS and SUTD). The various university representatives provided a comprehensive range of information relating to curriculum design, the unique programmes offered, and learning experiences students would be a part of during their tertiary education journey. They also provided information on university admissions and answered the queries our students had with regards to applying to local universities.</p>

<p>After the first segment, students had the chance to visit the various information booths set up in the Concourse by different industry and higher education partners. This enabled them to find out more about the interesting career and higher education opportunities as well as scholarships available. They were able to interact with personnel from the industries as well as university representatives. The Career and Higher Education Day proved to be an enriching experience for our students that will prepare them for their next milestone of university admission after graduating from junior college.</p>
