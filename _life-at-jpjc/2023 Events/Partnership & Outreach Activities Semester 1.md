JPJC understands the importance of engaging with prospective students and helping them make informed choices about their post-secondary education. To achieve this, we conduct outreach talks at secondary schools, to provide insights into our academic and co-curricular programmes and the overall college experience we offer. In addition, we organise dedicated engagement sessions to convey targeted information that addresses the unique needs and interests of prospective students considering our college as their institution of choice.</p>

<p>
One such initiative is the JC Immersion Programme held on 14 February, which provided an experiential immersion for 25 students from Jurong Secondary School. It included the attending of an Economics lecture, a Project Work demonstration, tutorial experiences, and a college tour. By offering a holistic understanding of JC education and subject-specific experiences, the immersion programme empowered students to make well-informed decisions about their educational pathways.</p>

<p>
On 31 March, our Humanities and Economics Departments organised an engagement session aimed at providing important information on subjects such as Economics, Geography, History, China Studies in English, and Art. Over 100 students from 11 secondary schools were introduced to the JC curriculum and had the opportunity to observe tutorials. Additionally, they had the chance to visit an exhibition created by JC1 Art students and participate in a hands-on activity led by an Art teacher.</p>

<p>
Another significant event was the DSA Tea Session on 19 May, which hosted over 50 students and teachers from different secondary schools. DSA-JC allows students to apply to a DSA school before their GCE O-Level examinations, based on their talents in sports, CCAs, and specific academic areas. The session began with a tea reception, fostering networking and meaningful connections. It also showcased JPJC's niche Talent Areas such as the Chinese and Malay Language Elective Programmes, STEM, and Art and Humanities Programmes. Students from JPJC also shared their personal experiences, offering a glimpse into transformative learning journeys, enriching internships, and notable achievements in prestigious competitions.</p>

<p>
Overall, these initiatives demonstrate JPJC's commitment to engaging with prospective students, providing them with valuable information, and showcasing the college's offerings to support their holistic educational journey. It also highlighted how JPJC caters to diverse interests and exceptional talents.</p>
