In a poignant moment of calm before the impending storm, our J2s celebrated their graduation at the Farewell Assembly and bid their friends and teachers a formal goodbye before leaving in preparation for the GCE A-Level Examination. It felt like just yesterday when they were freshmen of the college, chanting and screaming during J1 Matriculation &amp; Orientation in 2022. As Albert Einstein once said, “Time is relative”, and just like that, two years’ worth of storms and joys have flown by. </p>

<p>
In the first segment of the event, our J2s and their Civics Tutors had the opportunity to bond and gather for the last time as a class. This was followed by the Hall finale event, where the cohort commemorated this significant milestone, kickstarted by our Principal, Mr Kevin Ang’s address, followed by the CCA and Leadership Awards Ceremony and an address by the Chairperson of the JP Alumni Network, Mr Aaron Ting.</p>

<p>
After singing the college anthem as one in possibly the loudest fashion ever, the cohort erupted into ecstasy and... bubbles! Just like the bubbles they blew, our J2s left the hall, prepared to rise to the occasion of their upcoming examination. But of course, before heading off, the J2s couldn’t help but treat themselves to the celebration refreshments provided by the college. This was an excellent final opportunity to mingle with the rest of the JPFam.</p>

<p>
Despite leaving the port early, our J2s are indeed fully-equipped with the necessary ‘cargo’ and supplies for their journey ahead. Touched by the well-wishes of their teachers and parents from the video montage segments of the Hall finale, and blessed with gifts and welfare packs specially prepared by the college and Parents Support Group, and the Student Council, the J2s are ever-ready to rise to the occasion of steering right ahead despite life’s obstacles and rocky passages. We wish our J2s all the best for their A-Level Examination, and their greater journeys ahead in life!</p>
