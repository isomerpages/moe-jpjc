<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Orientation Group Leaders Camp (OGLC) 2023 was the first residential camp in three years to be hosted in Jurong Pioneer Junior College. Organised by the 5th Student Council, the three-day-two-night camp was held to prepare the Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) for their facilitation roles in the upcoming Matriculation and Orientation (M&O) for incoming JC1 students. There was a total of 162 OGLs and 49 Pre-University Seminar student facilitators who participated in the camp. The Pre-University Seminar student facilitators were invited to join the OGLC as the facilitation and debriefing techniques taught during the camp were also vitally relevant to their roles in the 2023 Pre-University Seminar.</p>

<p>On day one, the camp participants started their day with a rigorous bag check where they learnt the importance of personal responsibility and accountability. Following that, the participants also acquired debriefing skills and learnt a variety of songs and cheers pertinent to the conduct of M&O. One of the highlights was the Night Games, where participants pitted against the Hunters (played by the teachers and student councillors) in a battle of wits and courage as they sought to protect their tokens earned from the station games located around the college. </p>

<p>On day two, the participants underwent a fire drill in the early morning where they understood the importance of mastering and accurate execution of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) in the times of emergency. Other than that, the Scenario-Based Discussions also allowed the camp participants to explore possible solutions and countermeasures to various scenarios that could happen during the M&O. Other activities included the Mass Games and Discussions on House Entrance and Identity, during which OGLs drew closer to one another and forged a stronger sense of camaraderie. Later in the night, during the other highlight of the camp, the participants went on a Solo Night as they walked on their own, blindfolded, to designated locations where they sat down alone to reflect on their experiences in the camp. </p>

<p>The last day saw all participants wrapping up on their camp experiences and consolidating all that they had learnt, in preparation for imparting these very pearls of wisdom to their juniors during M&O. After area cleaning, the participants sat down in groups to share their thoughts and learning experiences throughout the camp. Some participants also volunteered to share with the camp on their learning points. OGLC 2023 was all in all a dynamic and fruitful learning experience for all who had the opportunity and privilege of participating in the event. </p>
