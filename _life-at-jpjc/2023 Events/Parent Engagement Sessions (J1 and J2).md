<p>At JPJC, our partnership with parents is greatly valued as it plays a crucial role in the holistic development of our students, ensuring they reach their fullest potential. The college firmly believes that our students can succeed and realise their fullest potential, when parents and the college work hand-in-hand. </p>

<p>The JC2 Parent Engagement Webinar was conducted on 27 January to communicate important information regarding the academic timeline and support structure for the JC2 students. In addition, an overview of the expectations and rigour of the JC2 curriculum was given. Further education and career guidance matters were also discussed with parents to better equip them in guiding their children in planning their future paths. Mr Jasper Liow, the Chairperson of JPJC Parent Support Group shared his experiences and insights, providing additional support and guidance to fellow parents. The webinar ended with a question-and-answer session, during which parents had the opportunity to clarify any questions they may have had. It was a valuable platform for parents to stay informed and engaged in their child’s education journey.</p>

<p>For parents of our JC1 students, the college had the opportunity to hold the first face-to-face parent engagement since the pandemic on 24 February. Our Principal, Mr Kevin Ang, shared his education philosophy, emphasising the importance of having the end in mind for students. He also highlighted the college’s vision, mission and values, which aim to foster holistic student achievement regardless of their L1R5 scores. He shared a couple of inspiring stories of resilience from the 2022 A-Level cohort as well, demonstrating the college’s commitment to nurturing students with confidence for the future.
