This year saw Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) united as one in co-organising Pre-University Seminar 2023 with the Curriculum Planning &amp; Development Division, Ministry of Education. Both staff and students came together and played host to 550 participants from 30 pre-university institutions as the event returned to a fully-residential format at the Nanyang Technological University. This was no mean feat, as this large-scale event involved varied complexities and challenges that the College gamely took on. The result was a meaningful and enriching event for all participants – one that bore testament to the JP Family’s heart to serve, and courage to venture into uncharted new territory. With the theme 'Towards Our Shared Future: SG75', all participants had the opportunity to engage in dialogues about Singapore's development, identity, values, and its place in the world amid global complexities. Through rich discussions and interactions with people of diverse backgrounds, students gleaned insights on a range of issues, policies, and perspectives, enabling them to envision and co-create their shared future together. </p>

<p>
As the co-host of this momentous event, JPJC demonstrated its unwavering commitment to making the event an outstanding success. With meticulous planning and dedication, the college identified enthusiastic and capable students to take on the pivotal roles of Emcees and Moderators in the conversations with both Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lawrence Wong and Minister for Education Mr Chan Chun Sing and distinguished panelists. Through a rigorous selection process and selection exercise, shortlisted candidates were then put through a series of intensive training sessions. These sessions aimed to equip them with the essential skills needed to shine in their roles - adaptability, quick thinking, and the art of effective moderation. Thanks to our students’ commitment and diligence, the Emcees and Moderators showcased their exceptional talent, ensuring smooth and engaging dialogues that contributed significantly to the success of this unforgettable event. Beyond this aspect, the college also took great care in training Student Facilitators to actively engage the participants throughout the seminar. Armed with the necessary skills and knowledge, the Student Facilitators created a welcoming and inclusive environment, fostering fruitful interactions and discussions among the participants. In addition, the Teacher Facilitators provided exemplary support in overseeing the projects of the participants. They provided invaluable guidance and mentorship, nurturing the students' ideas and helping them bring their projects to fruition. With the Teacher Facilitators' expert guidance, the participants were empowered to explore their creative potential and develop innovative solutions within their chosen sub-themes.</p>

<p>
The Guest-of-Honour for the Opening Ceremony was our Minister for Education, Mr. Chan Chun Sing. During his opening address, he engaged students in a dialogue on Singapore’s future and emphasised the importance of staying focused on Singapore’s challenges and being committed to overcoming them. </p>

<p>
The seminar aimed to encourage students to imagine new possibilities for Singapore in the next two decades, anticipating Singapore's 75th anniversary in 2040. By gaining an understanding of the prevailing contexts and driving forces that would shape Singapore's future, students discussed ways in which they could actively lay the foundations for the future they envisioned for Singapore. They worked in groups to delve into one of the three sub-themes – Living Together, Innovating Together, and Thriving Together – and developed an understanding of the complexities of issues within the sub-themes, such as the Singapore Identity, as well as the future of work and education.</p>

<p>
Throughout the event, dialogue sessions with experts, learning journeys, and panel discussions allowed students to understand more about their chosen sub-themes through the experiences and perspectives of Singaporeans. The seminar culminated in a showcase of the students' Solution Proposals in an exhibition during the Closing Ceremony, where they presented their vision for SG75 to invited guests. Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lawrence Wong graced the closing ceremony. </p>

<p>
All in all, this platform has offered unique opportunities for students to connect, exchange ideas, and contribute to shaping Singapore's path towards a prosperous future. Through the fruitful discussions and interactions, they will be well-equipped to co-create a better tomorrow for Singapore.</p>
