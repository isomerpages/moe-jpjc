<p>For this year’s annual JC2 SG Perspectives Engagement with a political office holder, our college welcomed Ms Gan Siow Huang, Minister of State (MOS) for Education and Manpower, on Wednesday 3 May 2023. MOS Gan’s presentation focused on the future of work and how our current education system aimed to help students achieve their career aspirations. She also shared about the wide availability of future career opportunities for students and how best to navigate the constant tension between passion and pragmatism when making their career choices.</p>

<p>
The student presentations and Q&amp;A session that followed allowed the students to broaden the conversation by sharing their desired work values and career aspirations, as well as raising many varied issues, such as concerns about the relevance of the current education system in preparing them for the future job landscape. Students greatly benefited from the interesting and candid insights shared by MOS Gan and crucially, they also learnt more about the complex thinking process behind the formulation of government policies through the interactive conversation with MOS Gan. Overall, the session proved to be a key highlight of the students’ Character and Citizenship Education experience in 2023.</p>
