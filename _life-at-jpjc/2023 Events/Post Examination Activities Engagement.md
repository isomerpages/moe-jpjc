<p> The Post Mid-Year Examination Engagement 2023 was organised with the intention of providing our JC2 students, who had just finished one of their milestone assessments, the time and space to unwind meaningfully. The post-examination activities consisted of a wide array of activities that were co-organised by the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department's Affective Development (AD) Committee, Education, Career Guidance (ECG) Committee, the Talent and Leadership Development and Arts and Aesthetics Committees, the Scholars Development Committee as well as the English Department.</p>

<p>Our JC2 students started the day with a sharing by JPJC's Senior ECG Counsellor, Ms Michelle Lee, who shared with the cohort crucial pointers to note for university applications. This is an important aspect of academic goal setting where students can use this knowledge to craft a realistic plan as they move closer towards the milestone of university applications in their academic journey. Following this engagement, our students went through the Admissions and Interviews Workshop conducted by Mr. Billy Wooton from the CCE/ECG Committee to allow our students to understand more about the interview processes when they apply for universities, which provided more useful reference points for their preparation. This was followed by a sharing by Brightsparks, a scholarships, higher education and career guidance portal, to provide a strong conclusion to this segment.</p>

<p>After a short break, our students had the valuable opportunity to listen to Mr Mustafa Kamal, CEO of the Black Hole Group - which manages more than ten restaurants - during the General Paper Speakers Series session entitled ‘Entrepreneurship in Singapore' organised by the English Department. During the session, Mr Kamal candidly shared about his journey and experiences as an entrepreneur with our students, allowing them to better understand the challenges that Small and Medium Enterprises in Singapore face.</p>

<p>Some students also continued with optional small group activities in the afternoon. Students in the Scholars Development Programme had the opportunity to attend a customised Interview Skills Workshop. At the same time, the Arts and Aesthetics Committee engaged interested students in a wide array of workshops held at the Goodman Arts Centre. These included a Sculpture Workshop, the Dragon Kiln Pottery Workshop and a Photography Walkabout. These workshops allowed for a better understanding and appreciation of the arts, while providing a valuable opportunity for our students to showcase their creative flair.</p>

<p>In all, the 2023 Post Mid-Year Examination Engagement Day offered our JC2 cohort a dedicated time and space for personal development and enrichment in a fun and meaningful way.	</p>
