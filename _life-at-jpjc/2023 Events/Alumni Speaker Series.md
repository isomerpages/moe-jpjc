<p>In April 2023, Cheong Wan Rong, an alumnus from Jurong Junior College (Class of 2009), returned to Jurong Pioneer Junior College to share his insights and inspire his juniors at the Alumni Speaker Series, a niche JP event jointly organised by the Partnerships &amp; Outreach and Education and Career Guidance Committees.&nbsp; Wan Rong obtained his Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Nanyang Technological University and was awarded the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies Research Analyst Study Award. He later went on to earn a Master's degree in Strategic Studies with a Certificate in Terrorism Studies.&nbsp; He is currently &nbsp;a Cyber Incident Responder at Morgan Stanley and has prior experience as a cyber threat intelligence analyst in cybersecurity operations.&nbsp; Given his rich experiences and expertise, Wan Rong was well-positioned to share about his journey in pursuing Psychology and how he has applied principles of this discipline to his work, at this event. Not only did our students gain valuable insights on the importance of taking the initiative in pursuing their own goals and aspirations, they were also given a glimpse into the diverse range of career opportunities available to Psychology graduates.</p>
