<p>In 2023, the Staff Welfare Committee organised an array of activities aimed at enhancing staff well-being and strengthening the bonds within the JPFam. The highlight of the year’s events was most definitely our Teachers' Day Celebrations, themed 'Nostalgia: Down Memory Lane’, held for the first time at Paradise Now in Safra Choa Chu Kang. This occasion was nothing short of unforgettable, as both teaching and non-teaching staff came together to enjoy a sumptuous buffet, showcase their vocal talents during lively karaoke sessions, engage in friendly dart competitions, and try their hand at bowling in state-of-the-art lanes. Our emcees added to the enjoyment by hosting entertaining quizzes and infusing humour into the atmosphere. The occasion was also graced by two esteemed College Advisory Committee members, Mr. Zhou Wenhan and Ms. Yong Puay Khim. Another key cornerstone of the committee’s efforts would be the Staff Wellness Activity Days, featuring activities like jogging along the Pang Sua Park Connector, and invigorating basketball and badminton sessions. In addition to these, a special highlight was the 'Kopitiam' session, led by our School Leaders Mr. Ang and Mr. Nah, who generously shared their secret recipes for brewing aromatic coffee and baking delectable madeleines. As the year concluded, it was evident that the activities in 2023 have forged strong bonds amongst the JPFam.</p>
