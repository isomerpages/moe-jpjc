<p>The 6 House Excos organised the inaugural House Bonding Day on 1st March for both the JC1 and JC2 cohorts. The objectives of the event were to foster House bonding and class bonding, and to build House spirit. The event consisted of three one-hour activities carried out on a rotational basis â€“ Laser Tag, the JPJC Murder Mystery Game and House Bonding time for JC1 and JC2.</p>

<p>For the JPJC Murder Mystery Game, Houses took turns reporting to LT3 and LT4 to be briefed. Each House was given one hour to gather clues and to solve the mystery. Four teams of ten members headed to designated classrooms every ten minutes to gather clues through games. When the teams returned, they shared the clues with the rest of the House members and attempted to provide the answer to the mystery by the end of the one hour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The invitation to participate in the JPJC Murder Mystery Game was extended to all JPJC staff, in a bid to include all members of the JP Family and encourage healthy and lively House engagement in the college. School leaders, teaching staff and administrative staff could submit their answers to the mystery. Correct submissions were awarded House points accordingly.</p>

<p>For the House Bonding time that took place at either the basketball courts or the Concourse, one JC1 class was paired up with another JC2 class. The one hour of bonding between the classes allowed the seniors and juniors of the same House to get to know more about one another, and build cross-level rapport and friendships.</p>

<p>It is hoped that through such House Bonding Days and other upcoming House activities this year, the spirit of camaraderie and a vibrant, strong college identity continue to be developed for all members of the JP Family.</p>
