<p>Our college’s commemoration of Total Defence Day (TDD) in February 2023 encompassed a wide range of activities with this year’s TDD theme “Together We Keep Singapore Strong” as its premise. This served as a timely reminder to our students that every Singaporean has a part to play in our daily lives to ensure that Singapore is prepared for crises and disruptions and that we remain resilient and united as one people.</p>

<p>The TDD programme kicked off during the JC2 Enrichment Week, with both JC2 students and staff participating in the Total Defence Trails, a project proudly pioneered by the Community Engagement Council (CEC). Led entirely by our JC2 students from CEC, CCE Reps and student volunteers, the interactive learning trails to the Central Business District, Chinatown, Kampong Glam, Singapore River and Singapore Discovery Centre aimed to showcase how the 6 pillars of Total Defence collectively play a critical role in securing our survival and prosperity as a nation. </p>

<p>For the JC2 TDD civics lesson, based on the context of food resilience, students were given the opportunity to discuss the potential trade-offs when deciding on alternative food options at the individual level, and to gain an appreciation of Singapore’s food security at the national level. The introduction of gaming elements using the theme of “MasterChef Singapore” further stimulated the students’ imagination, as seen in the various creative class video submissions highlighting their proposed efforts to ensure the sustainability of Singapore’s food supply.</p>

<p>On the other hand, JC1 students experienced a special Chingay National Education Assembly programme in the hall. Titled “Embrace Tomorrow”, the highly interactive show focused on helping our students understand the importance of volunteerism and the significance of the Chingay Parade in Singapore. The programme consisted of games and activities requiring the audience to participate. Through these fun activities, our students explored the idea of volunteerism and multiculturalism and in the process ignited their passion to contribute to Singapore at the individual level. Via the entire repertoire of TDD activities, JPJC was able to experience and witness for themselves the reality and essentiality of a united and resilient Singapore.
