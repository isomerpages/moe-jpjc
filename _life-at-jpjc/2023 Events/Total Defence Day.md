<p>On the 17th of February, Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) welcomed her fourth batch of students back to college for the release of the 2022 GCE A Level Examination results. While all candidates had the official option of receiving their results online, in line with Singapore’s exit from the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the college invited all students from the cohort to receive their results together in the college Hall – a welcome first after three years.
