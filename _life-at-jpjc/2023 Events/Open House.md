<p>After a two-year hiatus, Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) held its #WhyJP Open House on 13 January 2023, and welcomed approximately 1900 visitors to the college. In line with the theme, #WhyJP, which was conceptualised by the Media Production Club, our students and staff provided prospective students and their parents an insight into the five reasons why JP should be the college of choice for them. Our visitors witnessed for themselves the quality education provided, the wide variety of programmes offered, the vibrant student culture, our conducive environment and the warmth of our big JP family, to help them make informed decisions regarding college selection and subject combination.	</p>
	
<p>Our newly-appointed Principal Mr. Kevin Ang shared with our potential students why they should choose JPJC to embark on their junior college journey, citing the varied opportunities provided by the college for students to develop themselves holistically. In the Hall, prospective students and parents were enlightened about the JC curriculum and assessment formats through the Academic and Subject Combination Showcase, where teachers were on hand to respond to their queries. Mother Tongue Languages teachers were also present to provide expert knowledge regarding the Chinese and Malay Language Elective Programmes, both being signature niche programmes here at JPJC. At the concourse, the Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) booths also offered visitors a clearer view of the holistic education and varied CCA programmes offered here at JPJC. Various performing arts CCAs put up dynamic and vibrant performances, displaying their talents and providing prospective students a glimpse of how they could develop their interests and talents should they select JPJC as their college of choice.</p>

<p>The energy and vibrancy of JPJC college life was truly palpable at the #WhyJP Open House 2023, and it was an enriching experience for our visitors, and staff and students alike.</p>
