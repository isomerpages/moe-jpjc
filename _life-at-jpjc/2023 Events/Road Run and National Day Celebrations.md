<p>On the 8th of August 2023, the vibrant spirit of patriotism and unity filled the air as the college commemorated Singapore's 58th National Day with a series of exciting events. This year’s event was special because of increased student empowerment and ownership in conceptualising, creating and conducting every aspect of the celebration, from the National Day Observation Ceremony, to the Road Run, National Day Carnival and Concert segment of the celebration. Fittingly, this year’s National Day theme ‘Onward As One’ is a call for all Singaporeans to look forward confidently and move onward together in building our shared future as one united people.</p>

<p>The celebration began with the National Day Observance Ceremony. Students and staff gathered in the Hall, standing in respectful silence as the national anthem echoed through the college. The raising of the flag and reciting of the National Pledge renewed the sense of pride and reverence all staff and students have for the nation. This was followed by the reading of the National Day Message 2023 by our Education Minister, Mr Chan Chun Sing, and our, Principal Mr Kevin Ang giving the opening address for the day.</p>

<p>Following the Observance Ceremony, the Annual Road Run took centre stage. Competitive runners (students and staff) tested their mettle on the challenging route, while the rest of the students cheered them on with fervour. The atmosphere was electrifying as the competitors pushed their limits, showcasing their dedication to both fitness and House pride.</p>

<p>As the day progressed, the campus was transformed into a vibrant National Day Carnival ground, organised by our dynamic House Leaders. The Carnival boasted an array of fun-filled activities and games, symbolising the diversity and unity that define Singapore. A standout feature was the ‘Design Your Own National Day Tote Bag’ segment, where participants creatively displayed their love for the country through artistic designs.</p>

<p>The celebration reached its climax with the highly anticipated Road Run Prize Presentation &amp; National Day Concert. Excitement filled the air as winners of the Road Run were honoured for their remarkable showing, on stage. The celebration was far from over after the prize presentation, as the stage came alive with a special video embodying the theme ‘Onward as One’ featuring our Principal Mr Ang, followed by the Gameshow segment organised by the talented students from the CEC. Laughter and cheering filled the air as participants engaged in friendly competition, fostering a strong sense of camaraderie among the students. In addition, two student volunteer groups created the videos on the Journey of Singapore before and after the millennium, and these were showcased during the Gameshow as well.</p>

<p>To top it all off, the National Day Concert featured mesmerising performances by our very own JP Spotlight Finalists, showcasing their immense talent. A key highlight was that groups of student volunteers conceptualised and created their own JPJC music videos of popular National Day songs such as ‘One People, One Nation, One Singapore’, ‘In a Heartbeat’ and Home’. Our Choir also graced the stage, performing renditions of songs chosen by the students, captivating the audience and filling the air with the spirit of celebration. Finally, the singing of ‘Home’ served as a rousing finale to our SG58 celebration and brought much cheer to our college in Term 3.</p>

<p>The JP Family’s National Day Celebration in honour of Singapore's 58th Birthday was a resounding success, leaving all participants with cherished memories of unity, talent and national pride. This was the college’s first attempt at conducting a college-wide event with several different programmes combined, and its success bears strong testament to the fact that the JP Family always moves forward as one!.</p>
