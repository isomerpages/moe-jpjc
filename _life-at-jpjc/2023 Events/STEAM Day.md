<p>  In the spirit of providing opportunities for students to discover their strengths and further develop their interest in various disciplines, our College held its inaugural Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) Day on the 2nd of August 2023. A maiden collaboration project between the STEM Committee and the Arts &amp; Social Sciences Interest Programme, this event was inspired by STEAM Education’s growing traction in the education landscape given its invaluable multi-disciplinary approach to guiding inquiry and critical thinking.</p>

<p>On this note, the STEAM Day programme was conceptualised with the intent of allowing both students and staff to engage in interactive activities covering a range of&nbsp;disciplines – namely Biology, Chemistry, Computing, Mathematics, Physics and the Arts and Social Sciences. Under the guidance of their respective teacher mentors, close to 150 student facilitators from the various student interest groups came together and illustrated the practical applications of concepts through their booth showcases. In some instances, these took the form of simple and easily reproducible demonstrations that exemplified a scientific concept; in others, these involved delving deeper into a research inquiry topic through reasoned discussions.</p>

<p>Additionally, a booth featuring our students' work at SISTEMIC (Singapore International STEM Innovation Challenge), as well as booth showcases by NTU's College of Engineering provided further opportunities for students to hear from faculty experts and appreciate the real-life applications of scientific principles to authentic situations.</p>

<p>  All in all, STEAM Day certainly provided some respite for the student population in the midst of an academically hectic Term 3. An immersive experience, the hands-on elements at each booth enabled both staff and students to engage in experiential learning, as they witnessed the application of a scientific concept and gained insight into Arts and Social Sciences related research topics in a light-hearted manner.</p>
