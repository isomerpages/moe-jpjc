On 20th January, JPJC’s Student Councilors kickstarted the festivities by presenting mandarin oranges and greeting all teachers with auspicious New Year wishes in the morning. This year, our theme for celebration was ‘锣鼓喧天,’ or ‘Drumming in the New Year.’ A wide array of activities was lined up, from class activities to an inaugural Chinese New Year bazaar, as well as performances by our JP Family’s Arts & Aesthetic groups, staff and a professional external Lion Dance troupe.</p>

<p>
An hour was allocated to the students to participate in classroom activities in their respective Civics classes. Led by the Class Managers (CMs) and Assistant Class Managers (ACMs), students were tasked to decorate their classrooms with Chinese New Year decorations and ornaments they had made from scratch following fun and interactive video tutorials. The students also played a Chinese New Year quiz, where they learnt more about the customs and traditions of Chinese New Year. </p>

<p>
After the class activities, classes were split into two groups. Half the classes first visited the CNY bazaar booths at the concourse and enjoyed the performances at the same time. The other classes proceeded to the Hall to enjoy the performances via livestreaming and visited the cultural booths. In the bazaar at the concourse, there was a variety of lovely snacks, such as Korean food, ice cream and bubble tea sold by external vendors. Canteen vendors were also invited to the bazaar to sell finger food to the students and staff. In addition to that, there were student-initiated booths set up in the hall. Student facilitators manned the cultural booths and facilitated activities such as the guessing of lantern riddles, writing of Chinese calligraphy, making of CNY handicrafts, and learning the correct way to use chopsticks. Interact Club also set up a fundraising booth selling handmade handicrafts, to raise funds for ‘ItsRainingRaincoats’, an initiative for supporting the needs of migrant workers in Singapore.</p>

<p>
The performances put up by Concert Band, Chinese Orchestra, Guitar Ensemble and Indian Dance were very well-received by the audience and created a joyful and festive atmosphere. Even our very own Mother Tongue Languages Department teachers chipped in to contribute to the celebration. Mr. Yang Zhizhong showcased one of the most popular Tai Chi Quan techniques in Singapore, the Chen-style Tai Chi Quan. He wowed the crowds with his alternating fast and slow punches, feet banging and jumping. The song performance by Dr Kelvin Sng was equally impressive and engaging. Dr Sng was unanimously crowned our unofficial JP Idol with his effortlessly cool stage charisma and the meaningful lyrics ‘face the wind, embrace the rainbow and bravely strut on’ from the Chinese song ‘Your Answer.’</p>

<p>
JPJC is the only college in Singapore to offer both the Chinese and Malay Language Elective Programmes. As part of a special performance, the two LEPs had the opportunity to come together, with the CLEP students learning how to play the traditional Malay percussion musical instrument, the ‘kompang’, which originated from Indonesia which enliven the atmosphere and are integral in celebratory occasions. On the other hand, the MLEP students got to learn how to play the Chinese drums, which in the Chinese culture, is an essential element in creating a joyous and celebratory atmosphere which is very similar to the Malay kompang. Together they managed to integrate both instruments to create the "锣鼓喧天" atmosphere befitting of the theme of this year’s celebration.</p>

<p>
This year, our college also invited the Tian Eng Dragon & Lion Dance to perform in the finale. In Chinese culture, lion dance brings forth happiness, joy, prosperity, luck and success in important Chinese festivities and celebrations. The lion dance is a perfect combination of martial arts, acrobatics and even dance. As part of the finale programme, it was indeed a crowd puller and kept the audience captivated right till the very end. The God of Fortune Mascot and the two Southern Lions presented the auspicious scroll as well as plucking-the-green to our school leaders. Staff and students enjoyed interacting with the mascot and rushed to grab the gold coin chocolates which symbolize wealth and fortune. The finale event ended on a high note with the troupe’s dancing and drumming.</p>

<p>
Concluding JPJC’s 2023 CNY Celebration was a ‘lohei’ session and a sumptuous reunion buffet lunch for all staff. It was a new, meaningful and enjoyable celebration that well-received by both staff and students alike.</p>
