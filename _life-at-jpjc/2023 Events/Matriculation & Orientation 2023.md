<p> Matriculation & Orientation (M&O) 2023 was an enchanting experience for our incoming JC1 freshmen. With the abolishment of Safe Management Measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's event was held with mass face-to-face activities, providing an excellent opportunity for the students to get to know each other better, and forge even stronger bonds.</p>

<p>Held from 3 to 10 February, the theme for this year's M&O was ‘Enchanté’, which means ‘nice to meet you’ in French. The theme aimed to emphasise the importance of making new connections, forging new friendships, and exploring new opportunities. M&O, a significant event organised by the Student Council, brought together 191 Student Councillors (SCs) and Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) to induct and welcome all new JC1 students. Throughout the event, the JC1 students were provided with numerous opportunities to bond and interact with their classmates and seniors through engaging games and activities. The OGLs took on the responsibility of making sure that all students felt included, and warmly welcomed all of them, and the result was a sense of camaraderie and unity among the students.</p>

<p>The six-day event culminated in a grand finale, featuring the dances and cheers by OGLs and JC1s from the all the six Houses. The college spirit was on full display, and the energy was contagious as everyone participated in the college cheer and dance with passion and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Overall, M&O 2023 was a resounding success, setting the tone for a memorable academic year ahead. The event not only provided an excellent opportunity for the new students to start their JC journey on strong footing, but also instilled in them the values of teamwork and unity that will serve them well in both their academic and personal pursuits.
