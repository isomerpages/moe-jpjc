<p>The college’s Service Learning Festival 2023 successfully brought together Social Service Agencies (SSAs), charitable organisations and our very own students with volunteering experience to raise awareness about philanthropy and social causes in Singapore. During the event, featured organisations such as Food Bank, the Ministry of Manpower’s ACE Group, the Down Syndrome Association, and World Vision provided valuable insights into the world of volunteering and provided a glimpse of the many challenges present in society today, inspiring our students to make a difference by contributing in their own ways. The sharing conducted by JPJC students who are involved in volunteer work in the community also saw them rallying their peers to do their part for society.</p>

<p>In addition, the Disability Awareness Games organised by students from the Interact Club sensitised participants to the challenges faced by persons with disabilities in their daily lives, through a series of obstacle courses and activities designed to simulate real-life experiences.</p>

<p>Overall, the Service Learning Festival served as a platform for students to deepen their understanding of social issues, explore meaningful avenues for involvement, and foster a sense of service and empathy. The event empowered students to become compassionate and responsible citizens who are willing to step up and make significant contributions to society.</p>
