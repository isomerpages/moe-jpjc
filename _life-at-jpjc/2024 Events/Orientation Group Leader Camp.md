<p>The Orientation Group Leader Camp (OGLC) was thoughtfully designed to instill key leadership skills and values in Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) and Student Councillors (SCs), aiming to provide incoming first-year junior college students (J1s) with a memorable Matriculation &amp; Orientation (M&amp;O) experience. OGLC served as a crucial platform for OGLs and SCs to practise and refine the programme elements and communication strategies that would be essential during M&amp;O.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moreover, OGLC was a pivotal setting for building strong relationships and camaraderie between SCs and OGLs, relationships expected to extend beyond the event. It offered a unique opportunity to adjust and improve strategies by leveraging the feedback and observations gathered during the camp, thereby enhancing the forthcoming M&amp;O experience for both J1s and their leaders.</p>
