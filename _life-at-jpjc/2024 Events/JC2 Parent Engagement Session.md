<p>On 26 January 2024, JPJC successfully hosted the JC2 Parent Engagement
Session, a face-to-face event that offered us the opportunity to reconnect
with the parents of our JC2 students. The event saw an excellent turnout
with enthusiastic participation from the parents.</p>
<p>The session commenced with an interaction segment between Civics Tutors
and the parents of their students, filling the concourse with lively chatter
over dinner. Thereafter, everyone reconvened at Lecture Theatre 4, where
our Principal, Mr Kevin Ang, officially welcomed the parents. In his address,
Mr Ang shared about JPJC’s achievements over the past year and highlighted
the importance of the college-home partnership in our collective aim to
support our students.</p>

<p>In the next part of the session, our JC2 Year Head, Mr Koh, shared information
on the college calendar and assessment milestones for the JC2 year. Mr
Koh went on to provide pertinent details about the Tiered Support System
that JPJC utilises to offer tailored facilitation for various students'
needs. Additionally, Mr Koh explained to parents about the newly introduced
Self-Directed Learning Afternoon (SDLA) slots in the JC2 timetable. These
SDLA slots provide students with dedicated time for asynchronous learning,
which has been incorporated into their timetable.</p>
<p>Following this, the Senior School Counsellors, Mrs Estelle Ow and Ms Elaine
Tay, communicated various ways in which parents can reach out to and support
their children as they navigate this challenging year leading up to their
A-level examinations. JPJC’s Senior Education and Career Guidance Counsellor,
Ms Michelle Lee, then supplemented this sharing with a closer look at Singapore’s
University Landscape.</p>
<p>The JC2 Parent Engagement Session was an enriching session for all, and
the college will continue to work closely with parents to foster greater
college-home partnership to ensure the holistic development of all students.</p>
