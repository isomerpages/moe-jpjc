<p>On 1 March 2024, JPJC successfully hosted the JC1 Parent Engagement Session, a face-to-face event aimed at establishing strong connections with the parents of our JC1 students. The session saw an excellent turnout with enthusiastic participation from the parents. </p>

<p>After a sumptuous buffet dinner in the concourse, the session commenced in Lecture Theatre 4 with a welcome address by our Principal, Mr Kevin Ang. Mr Ang shared the culture of #infinitelove, #infinitegrowth and #infinitepossibilities that have propelled JPJC’s achievements over the past year. He highlighted the importance of the college-home partnership in supporting our students collectively. Vice-Principal, Mr Nah Hong Leong, then shared details about the changes within the JC curriculum and the university landscape.</p>

<p>In the next part of the session, our JC1 Year Head, Mr Subash Ramiah, shared key events on the college calendar for the JC1 students in 2024. Mr Subash also provided pertinent details about JPJC’s Tiered Support System, tailored to meet the needs of various students. Following this, our Subject Head of Partnerships, Ms Veronica Low, and Chairperson of the Parent Support Group, Mr Jasper Liow, emphasised the importance of strengthening relationships between parent and college to provide the best support for students. </p>

<p>Segment 1 of the session concluded with Project LOVE, where parents wrote heartfelt letters to their children, to be shared with the students during the Farewell Assembly in JC2. </p>

<p>Segment 2 took place in the classrooms, where parents had the opportunity to meet with their child’s Civics Tutors. During this segment, Civics Tutors shared pertinent information on the E-Portfolio and how parents can support the child’s journey in consolidating a strong E-Portfolio. </p>
  
<p>The JC1 Parent Engagement Session was fruitful for all involved, and the college will continue to work closely with parents to foster greater college-home partnerships, ensuring the holistic development of all students.
