<p>STEAM Day is a key event of the college’s STEAM Programme to spark curiosity, ignite interest and recognize students' talent in STEM/STEAM. The event is a celebration of interdisciplinary, and creative thinking, in tackling real-world problems using science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics through project showcases.</p>

<p>This year, STEAM Day is organised by the STEAM Interest Group with support from the STEAM Committee. There was an exciting lineup of activities including talks by alumni and industry partners, interactive booths and project showcases by our students, staff and partners revolving around the theme Innovations - Sustainable and Inclusive Urban City.</p>

<p>The students had the opportunities to engage with speakers from the STEAM industries on their journey in using research and innovation to create a more sustainable and inclusive urban city. The speakers include Ms.Jeanne Li, from Chevron Singapore, Dr. Goh Guo Liang from NTU Singapore Centre for 3D Printing, and alumni Mr. Chio Wen Tian, from CHIO Architects, and Mr. Tan Ying Quan from Barramundi Group.  </p>
	
<p>Another highlight of the event was the showcase of STEAM research and innovation projects at the concourse. Some interesting booths included an interactive booth on renewable energy by JPJC’s Team Phoenix Racers who took part in the "Horizons Hydrogen Grand Prix" where they used hydrogen fuel cells to power their RC car, and the "Sustainable Future Cities" project by students in the STEAM Interest Group who presented prototypes of the future Marina Bay area which they envisaged. In addition, there were partner booths where students learnt how "Black Soldier Flies" could be a solution to our food waste problem, and a craft station by NTU where they got to use 3D pens to create designs. Some of our teachers also stepped forward to showcase their AI image recognition project and food sustainability research project.</p>
	
<p>There was also a centre-stage presentation by the best booth, Project Panello Solare, as voted by our teacher judges. The event concluded with an exciting lucky draw, where 10 fortunate winners who scored 80% or higher on the STEAM Day quiz walked away with fantastic 3D pens. It was indeed an incredible day of learning to discover the infinite possibilities of STEAM as a solution to real world problems! </p>
