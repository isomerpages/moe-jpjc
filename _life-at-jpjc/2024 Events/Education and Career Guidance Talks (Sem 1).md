<p>For JPJC Service Learning and Careers Festival 2024, six career talks were organised for our #JPFam. These sessions have not only broadened students' horizons but also instilled in them a sense of purpose and direction as they continue to embark on their career journeys.</p>
	
<p>In the healthcare sector, Senior Staff Nurse at Alexandra Hospital, Ms Ng Yan Shan recounted her experiences in nursing, igniting a sense of purpose and compassion in our students whilst Senior Medical Social Worker at Alexandra Hospital, Ms Tan Zhi Tong, shared the complexities and rewards in providing quality care to patients.  In the sustainability sector, Manager for Communications and Community Engagement at National Parks Board (NParks), Ms. Enna Lam, provided an overview of career opportunities offered by the government agency. This sparked our studentsâ€™ interest in environmental stewardship. We also had Mr Clarence Chua, an award-winning entrepreneur from the Sundowner Nature Experience Centre who provided a roadmap for students aspiring to merge their passions with meaningful careers in sustainability. In the social service sector, Ms. Ng Shan Yi, a Family Coach at the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), shared the opportunities available in this fulfilling and impactful field while Ms. Lorraine Chee, Head of Community Engagement at Touch Young Arrows, advocated efforts aimed at making a difference in society. The insights provided inspired students to consider social service as a viable and fulfilling career option. </p>
<p>The enriching talks will definitely be useful in helping our #JPFam make informed decisions on their career choices. </p>

<p>In addition, on 8 May, JPJC hosted an enriching Careers Day, featuring a lineup of seven esteemed speakers who engaged our JC2 students in insightful career talks. This event was a testament to our commitment to providing comprehensive career guidance and exploration opportunities for our students.</p>
<p>The event showcased a diverse array of career sectors, catering to the varied interests indicated by our students at the start of the year. </p>
<p>Speakers represented fields such as IT/Cybersecurity, Engineering, Finance, Fintech, Healthcare, Psychology, and Science Research. Students were able to select sessions based on their career interests, ensuring a tailored and relevant experience for each attendee.</p>
<p>This year, we were pleased to announce two new partnerships which significantly enriched our program. Thanks to ECG committee's collaboration with Partnership &amp; Outreach committee, we welcomed two parents who generously volunteered to share their industry insights with our students.</p>
<p>A particularly impactful session featured an alumni speaker who recounted his transformative journey. From being an unmotivated JC student, he discovered his passion for combatting climate change through Mathematics. His story resonated deeply, inspiring students with the potential for personal growth and meaningful contributions in their chosen fields.</p>

<p>The Psychology session garnered exceptional interest, with an overwhelming number of students eager to explore the nuances of a career in this field. This highlights the growing curiosity and awareness among our students regarding the diverse career opportunities available.</p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon, students actively engaged with speakers during the question and answer segments, gaining valuable insights into the realities and requirements of various careers. This interactive component fostered a deeper understanding and appreciation for the professional pathways discussed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Careers Day at JPJC empowered our JC2 students with valuable knowledge and inspiration as they embark on their future career journeys. We extend our heartfelt thanks to all speakers, and committee members whose efforts made this event possible. We look forward to continuing our mission of guiding and preparing our students for their future endeavors.</p>

<p>With the valuable insights gained from various career talks in Semester 1 by our wonderful partners, especially our alumni and parents, our students had incredible opportunities to discover their areas of interest.
