<p>On 15 May 2024, our JC1 students and teachers had the privilege of attending a "Dialogue Session with Distinguished Speaker” from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). We were honoured to welcome Mr. Lawrence Anderson, a Senior Fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies at NTU, who shared his extensive knowledge on Singapore’s foreign policies. Mr. Anderson provided a comprehensive overview of Singapore’s strategic international engagements and diplomatic efforts. He also emphasised the importance of maintaining strong relationships in navigating global politics.</p>
<p>The dialogue session was highly interactive, with students eagerly posing thought-provoking questions. Mr. Anderson responded with remarkable depth and clarity, offering valuable perspectives that enriched the students' understanding of global affairs and Singapore’s diplomatic strategies. His articulate explanations and real-world examples brought abstract concepts to life, making the discussion both engaging and educational.</p>
<p>The event concluded successfully, leaving a profound impact on all attendees. The students gained significant knowledge about the intricacies of foreign policy, and the critical role diplomacy plays in ensuring national security and prosperity. We extend our deepest gratitude to Mr. Anderson for his time and for sharing his expertise with our community. His insights have undoubtedly inspired many students to further explore the field of international relations.
