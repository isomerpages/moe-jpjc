<p>Matriculation and Orientation (M&amp;O) 2024, themed 'Mirage' and encapsulated by the tagline "Breaking Boundaries, Limitless Possibilities," sets a visionary tone for incoming first-year junior college students (J1s). This tagline motivates J1s to venture beyond their comfort zones, exploring new avenues and uncovering their boundless potential. The journey emphasises the significance of teamwork, drawing an analogy to adept spy agents on a complex mission, to underscore the collective endeavour of J1s as they navigate the challenges of junior college. Through a variety of M&amp;O activities, they share experiences, building a foundation of shared stories. The theme, ‘Mirage’ underlines the power of collaboration in demystifying the aspects of junior college life, highlighting the journey of self-discovery in partnership with classmates, House members, and peers.</p>

<p>The five-day programme was carefully curated to promote interaction and fellowship among the J1 students, aiming to create a unified spirit through engaging games and activities. Informative sessions provided detailed insights into the subject offerings and programmes available at the college. Additionally, expansive dance sessions and college cheers were integral parts of the programme designed to foster a deep sense of belonging among the students.</p>
