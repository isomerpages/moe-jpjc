<p>During the J2 Enrichment Week, our JC2 students engaged in various Citizenship Education Learning Experiences tailored to their interests. These included a camp visit to Mandai Hill Camp and signing up for a student-led walking trail in the civic district and Chinatown area.</p>

<b>Visit to 11 C4I Bn at Mandai Hill Camp on 2 February 2024</b><br>
On 2 February 2024, 200 JC2 students visited Mandai Hill Camp to gain insights into the critical role our ARMY plays in our military defense and explore opportunities for contributing  to Total Defence. 
During the visit, SAF personnel from the 11 C4I Battalion shared valuable insights with our students on how the unit utilises technology to enhance their combat intelligence capabilities. <p></p>

<p>Students had the opportunity to observe static displays and received informative explanations from the SAF personnel on the use of First-Person View (FPV) Drones, Tactical Unmanned Aerial vehicles (TUAV), and Reconnaissance Surveillance &amp; Target Acquisition (RSTA) for reconnaissance missions. 
In addition, students actively participated in various hands-on activities, including SAR 21 weapon handling, face camouflage application, tasting combat field rations, engaging in Soldiers' Fundamental Fitness Workouts, and experiencing drone flight under controlled conditions. 
It was indeed an eye-opening learning experience for all participants.
