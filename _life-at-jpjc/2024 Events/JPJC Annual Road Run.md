<p>We are excited to share the highlights of our Annual Road Run, held on May 24th at the scenic OCBC Square at the Sports Hub! Despite a persistent drizzle, the enthusiasm and determination of our participants remained unwavering. As they say, the show must go on, and it did, with runners pushing through the weather to achieve remarkable personal best timings. Their resilience was truly inspiring.</p>

<p>Students and staff competitors put in their best effort, showcasing their hard work and commitment. Each stride reflected their intense preparation and passion for the sport. Adding to the excitement was the refreshing breeze and breathtaking views along the route. Runners were treated to an invigorating experience, making every stride a memorable one.</p>

<p>As runners approached the finish line, students lined the route, cheering with great excitement. Their enthusiastic support created an electrifying atmosphere, motivating the runners to give their all in the final stretch. Additionally, students and staff enjoyed a fun walk along the route in the drizzle, sharing moments of laughter and friendship. The shared experience fostered a strong sense of community and camaraderie.</p>

<p>We're thrilled to congratulate Aquila House for their outstanding performance and teamwork, earning them the title of Champion House! Their dedication and perseverance have set a shining example for all.
