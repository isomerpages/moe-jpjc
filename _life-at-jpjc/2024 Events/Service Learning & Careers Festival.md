<p>The Service Learning (SL) &amp; Careers Festival embodied a harmonious blend of altruism, education, and professional discovery, underscoring the collegeâ€™s commitment to holistic development. Representatives from Social Service Agencies (SSA) enthusiastically manned booths, unveiling a plethora of volunteering opportunities, while career talks in the lecture theaters illuminated pathways in the social service sector, sparking aspirations among students.</p>

<p>Concurrently, student-led initiatives shone brightly, with activities designed to raise awareness of the needs of the physically disabled, notably through the engaging Disability Awareness Games orchestrated by the Interact Club. These games transcended barriers, fostering empathy and understanding within the college community. Additionally, student-run booths, such as the Choir and the Eco Club, further enriched the festival, amplifying messages of elderly care, sustainability and environmental consciousness.</p>

<p>One of the standout moments was a booth dedicated to raising awareness about bone marrow donation, providing hope and life-saving information to eager participants. Another highlight was&nbsp; a career talk featuring the founder of The Sundowner Nature Experience Centre, a distinguished alumnus, whose journey from student to social entrepreneur inspired and empowered attendees.</p>

<p>As the festival unfolded, it served as a vibrant tapestry of learning, service, and career exploration, leaving an indelible mark on the college's ethos and the aspirations of its students. In the annals of college events, the SL &amp; Careers Festival stood as a testament to the transformative power of community engagement and personal growth.
