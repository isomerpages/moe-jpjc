<p>Jurong Pioneer Junior College conducts outreach activities to attract potential secondary school students by showcasing its academic excellence, vibrant campus life, and diverse co-curricular opportunities. Through these activities, the college aims to foster interest, build rapport, and address any misconceptions about junior college education. The outreach also provides insights into the college's unique programmes, supportive environment, and pathways for personal growth, inspiring prospective students to consider JPJC as their preferred educational institution.</p>

<p>To this end, the Partnership &amp; Outreach Committee organised two signature events, the first of which was the JC Immersion Programme held on February 21 that hosted 63 students from our top five feeder schools. These students engaged in talks regarding JC education, heard alumni sharing their JPJC experiences, and embarked on a college tour highlighting various CCAs. This event aimed to provide insights into JPJC's academic and co-curricular offerings, fostering connections and interest among prospective students from feeder schools.</p>

<p>The DSA Tea Session, another highlight of JPJCâ€™s outreach effort, was held on 17 May. This event welcomed approximately 40 students from nine secondary schools that offered them a chance for JC education based on their talents in CCAs and specific academic areas. Through engaging presentations, students were introduced to the diverse educational offerings at JPJC such as Art and History for Humanities, opportunities for deeper engagement in STEAM, as well as our unique dual Language Elective Programmes for Chinese and Malay. Moreover, they were briefed on the opportunities that niche CCAs offer for further development of their skills and potential. Interactive breakout sessions further allowed these students to interact with current JPJC students, gaining valuable insights into the college experience and its transformative impact. The event aimed to empower students with the knowledge and resources needed to make informed decisions about their educational journey, fostering a sense of excitement and anticipation for what lies ahead at JPJC.  </p>
	
<p>In conclusion, these efforts reflect JPJC's dedication to connecting with future students, imparting crucial insights, and presenting the college's array of opportunities to enrich their educational voyage. They underscore JPJC's embrace of varied passions and remarkable potential, fostering a culture of Infinite Love, Infinite Growth, and Infinite Possibilities.  </p>
