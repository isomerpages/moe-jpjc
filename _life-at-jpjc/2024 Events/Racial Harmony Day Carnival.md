<p>On 17 July, our college proudly hosted a vibrant Racial Harmony Day Carnival, embodying our commitment to unity in diversity under the theme "Our Multicultural Mosaic". The event, organised in collaboration with OnePeople.sg, was a resounding success, bringing together students, staff, and guests from Choa Chu Kang Secondary School and Teck Whye Primary School in a celebration of our rich cultural tapestry.</p>

<p>During the carnival, our campus buzzed with excitement as attendees explored 12 engaging booths. These booths, meticulously prepared by our CCA groups and students from CEC, showcased traditions from various ethnicities, offering interactive experiences that fostered learning and appreciation.</p>

<p>The highlight of the carnival was the enthusiastic participation of everyone in traditional ethnic attire, adding a colourful and festive flair to the atmosphere. Students and staff alike embraced the opportunity to learn from one another and celebrate our differences, reinforcing the values of tolerance and respect within our community.  </p>
	
<p>The event also featured a symbolic activity where attendees collected beads from different booths to create friendship bands, promoting bonds of unity and understanding among participants.
The celebration was a testament to our shared commitment to fostering an inclusive and harmonious environment. We eagerly anticipate next year's celebration and the opportunities it will bring to further strengthen our bonds!</p>
