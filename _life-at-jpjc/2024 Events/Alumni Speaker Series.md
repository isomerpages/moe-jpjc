<p>On 7 February 2024, JPJC successfully organised the inaugural Alumni Speakers Series in conjunction with JC2 Enrichment Week. Eight distinguished alumni from both Jurong Junior College and Pioneer Junior College returned to their alma mater to share their educational and career journeys across various industries and sectors. JC2 students had the opportunity to select sessions based on their interests and inclinations, engaging in face-to-face interactions with the alumni speakers in various venues throughout the event.</p>
<p>The event commenced with our Principal, Mr Kevin Ang, presenting tokens of appreciation to the alumni before they proceeded to their respective venues, to meet with eager students awaiting their insights. </p>
<p>The eight alumni included:</p> 
<p>1.	Dr Sim Siang Meng, Researcher @DSO<br>2.	Ms Veronica Loh, Senior Learning &amp; Development Program Manager at Amazon Web Services
<br>
3.	Mr Arron Yeap, Financial Services Director at Prudential Assurance
<br>4.	Mr Vincent Lau, Serial Technopreneur, Allocate Space &amp; Pylon Space 
<br>5.	Mr Loo Cheng Chuan, Entrepreneur, Premiummall
<br>6.	Professor Pey Kin Leong, Associate Provost atSUTD 
<br>7.	Mr Sebastian Shen, Entrepreneur and Coach at Haulio 
<br>8.	Mr Zhou Wenhan, Technopreneur @SmartWalkie.com</p>
<p>Each speaker shared rich experiences from their respective journeys, providing invaluable industry insights to the students. These sessions undoubtedly broadened the students’ horizons on the world of work, and motivated them to develop essential skills and dispositions for their future careers and lives. 
Any lingering questions in the students’ minds were expertly addressed by the alumni speakers in an engaging manner, fostering a dynamic exchange of ideas. Selected students who posed particularly thoughtful questions were rewarded with an invitation to a reception with the speakers following their sessions, providing an opportunity for deeper interaction.  </p>
<p>Witnessing both current and past students engaging with each other over good food was a heartwarming sight, as was seeing our alumni reconnect with their alma mater and teachers! The Alumni Speaker Series proved to be an  enriching session for all involved, and we eagerly anticipate the next edition.</p>
