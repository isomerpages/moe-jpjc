<p>The Green Bazaar is organised every year in celebration of Earth Day. This year, we aimed to elevate the event by involving even more members of our school community. The Eco Club students collaborated with various student groups, including several J1 CCE representatives, the JP Dance Club, GymFit and PlayArt. Their enthusiastic participation added exciting games and creative artworks to the bazaar, making it a truly engaging event for all.</p>

<p>A major highlight this year was the Eco Club students selling their DIY gardening kits for the first time. The response was overwhelming, with more than 200 students purchasing the kits for themselves and their loved ones. Additionally, we are proud to announce that through the sale of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) merchandise, JPJC raised over $700 for SPCA, contributing to a very worthy cause.</p>

<p>In addition to our internal collaborations, we invited external vendors such as Chengtai Nursery and The Eco Statement to join us. They brought a wonderful array of sustainability-related lifestyle products, such as Eco-related card games, edibles and ornamental plants, offering attendees the opportunity to purchase eco-friendly items and learn more about sustainable living practices.</p>

<p>The Green Bazaar was an event brimming with fun, learning, and community spirit. It provided a platform for students, teachers, and visitors to connect over their shared commitment to environmental conservation. We are grateful to everyone who contributed to and attended the event. We hope that the experience inspired all to continue making eco-conscious choices in their daily lives. Together, let's keep working towards a greener future!</p>
