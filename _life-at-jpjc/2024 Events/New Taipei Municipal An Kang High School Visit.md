<p>On April 16th, the Internationalisation Committee of Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) orchestrated a cultural exchange, hosting over 30 students and educators from New Taipei Municipal An Kang High School (新北市立安康高级中学). In an interconnected world, nurturing civic, global, and cross-cultural literacy is not merely advantageous but imperative for our students. This event exemplified JPJC’s commitment to this cause, offering students a unique opportunity to engage with diverse perspectives without traversing national boundaries.</p>

<p>Led by a passionate student planning committee, 35 JC1 students assumed the role of ambassadors, extending warm hospitality and sharing insights into Singapore's educational landscape while eagerly absorbing knowledge about Taiwan's culture and educational system. From lively classroom interactions to shared local-style meals, the exchange facilitated authentic dialogue, cultural immersion, and enduring friendships.</p>

<p>Through these meaningful encounters, students gained a deeper appreciation for the nuances of different cultures, fostering a sense of global citizenship and interconnectedness. Beyond academic discourse, the exchange provided a platform for students to explore the similarities and differences between their respective contexts, enriching their educational journey with invaluable insights and experiences. By fostering meaningful connections and promoting mutual respect, this event epitomised the spirit of global collaboration and lifelong learning, inspiring participants to embrace diversity and cultivate a more inclusive world.
