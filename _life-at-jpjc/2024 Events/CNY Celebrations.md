<p>Before the Chinese New Year, students from the Community Engagement Council dedicated their efforts to assembling festive hampers for our Operation Support Officers (OSOs), affectionately known as the “uncles” and “aunties” who work tirelessly to maintain our school facilities every day. This heartwarming initiative was made possible through the generous contributions from the staff of the JP Fam, demonstrating the warmth and love within our college community. Special thanks to the students from the Chinese Cultural Society who lovingly handcrafted the decorations for the hampers, adding a personal touch to each gift. </p>
	
<p>On 8 February, our Principal and Vice-Principals took the opportunity to express our gratitude by presenting these hampers to the OSOs, a gesture that symbolised our deep appreciation we hold for their relentless efforts. A staff “Lohei” and a buffet lunch further fostered a sense of camaraderie among the staff, creating an atmosphere of abundance and goodwill as we ushered in the new year together.</p>
	
<p>On 9 February, Student Councillors embarked on a mission to spread joy and blessings by presenting mandarin oranges and heartfelt New Year wishes to members of the staff, infusing the college with a festive spirit of cheer and unity.</p>
	
<p>Under the theme “Blaze Beginning”, our celebrations ignited the spirit of renewal and hope, uniting students and staff in a joyous celebration of new beginnings. From heartwarming senior-junior class bonding sessions to captivating performances by our JP Fam’s aesthetic groups, every moment was imbued with the spirit of togetherness and optimism.</p>
<p>The performances by the Chinese Orchestra, Concert Band, and JP Dance Club touched the hearts of all present, radiating joy and inspiration. Dr. Kelvin Sng's soulful rendition of “我相信” (I Believe) moved the audience with its message of hope and resilience. Meanwhile, the mesmerising Dragon Dance finale charged the atmosphere with electric energy, symbolising prosperity and good fortune for the year ahead.</p>
<p>In these moments of celebration, we were reminded of the strength and unity that define our JPJC community, where each individual contributes to the vibrant tapestry of our college life. As the festivities drew to a close, we carried with us the spirit of renewal and camaraderie, ready to embark on the journey ahead with optimism and determination.
