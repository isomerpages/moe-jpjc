<p>On 2 August 2024, the college held its CCA Leaders Installation for the newly elected JC1 Student Councillors and CCA Leaders (Captains, Vice Captains, Presidents, and Vice Presidents). This marked the first time a combined ceremony was held to commemorate both the investiture of the 7th Student Councillors and the installation of the 7th CCA Leaders. The theme chosen for this event was ‘Nebula’, signifying the vast potential and collaborative spirit that the student leaders bring to the college community.</p>

<p>The ceremony was attended by Principal Mr Kevin Ang, Vice Principals Mr Nah Hong Leong, Mrs Lee Bee Cheow, and Mr Phua Yong Swee, Heads of Departments, all teaching staff, JC1 students, and 180 external guests, including parents, guardians, and representatives from various Junior Colleges. JC1 students were seated with their CCAs, proudly donning their CCA t-shirts, further fostering a sense of belonging and unity.</p>

<p>In his opening address, Principal Mr Kevin Ang commended the newly elected leaders for their courage in stepping forward to serve their college community. He highlighted the significance of this milestone as the beginning of their leadership journey. Mr Ang emphasised the importance of embodying the college's core values of Integrity, Responsibility, Resilience, Respect, and Compassion, urging the leaders to inspire their peers and contribute to a vibrant and supportive environment.  </p>
	
<p>Mr Ang also shared his vision for leadership within the college, anchored by the college's mission to nurture a community of active learners, innovative thinkers, and compassionate leaders. He encouraged the student leaders to lead with GRACE, which stands for Growth Mindset, Resilience, Affective Relationship Skills, Cognitive Skills, and Ethical Decision-Making. These attributes, he stressed, are essential in navigating the complexities of leadership and creating a positive impact on the college community.</p>

<p>The President of the 7th Student Council, Yu Jian Hui, Lucas from 24S05, addressed the college for the first time. In his speech, Lucas reflected on the challenges and triumphs of his leadership journey, acknowledging the support and camaraderie of his peers. He shared the lessons learned during the Leadership Training Camp (LTC), where student leaders from various CCAs bonded and grew together, overcoming obstacles and building a cohesive leadership community. Lucas urged his fellow leaders to embrace their roles with courage and compassion, to inspire through their actions, and to lead with integrity.</p>
	
<p>The ceremony proceeded with the introduction of each CCA leader by name. Following the introductions, the leaders representing each CCA struck poses unique to their CCA, adding a lively and memorable element to the event. The ceremony concluded with a red carpet walk-in segment featuring all the CCA leaders and the recitation of the leaders’ pledge, led by Lucas, symbolising their unity and shared commitment to leading the college towards a brighter future.</p>

<p>In his closing remarks, Lucas encouraged the JC1s to support their leaders, emphasising that the journey ahead would be challenging but rewarding. He expressed his confidence in the leaders’ ability to rise to the occasion and contribute to the college’s vision: A college with a heart to serve and the courage to venture. Lucas ended his speech with a powerful reminder that each leader is a star within the “Nebula” of JPJC, collectively shining brightly and creating infinite possibilities for growth and success.</p>
	
<p>The 2024 Student Leaders Installation Ceremony was a resounding success, celebrating the spirit of leadership and the promise of a united, vibrant future for the college community.</p>
