<p>We extend our sincerest gratitude to all who graced us with their presence at Arts@Assembly! It was an unforgettable showcase of talent, passion, and camaraderie that truly brought our college together in celebration of the arts.</p>

<p>From the enchanting melodies of the Chinese Orchestra (which features a rap segment!!) to the harmonious tunes of the Concert Band, the soul-stirring performances by the Choir, the rhythmic melodies of the Guitar Ensemble, and the playful dance displays by the Malay Cultural Society, each act illuminated the stage with its unique charm and artistry.</p>

<p>Not forgetting the mesmerising performance by the JP Dance crew, whose powerful yet serene energy guided us through a captivating journey of movement and expression. And equally noteworthy was the gripping performance by the English Drama Society, which transported us through a story of laughter, tears, and everything in between.</p>

<p>Arts@Assembly was a testament to the rich tapestry of talents present within our community, showcasing a diverse range of genres and styles that truly spoke to the vibrancy of our arts scene. This event not only celebrated creativity but also fostered a sense of unity and connection among attendees, highlighting the unique and inclusive spirit of our college. The passion and dedication of our talented performers, along with the wonderful support from the audience, made for a fantastic afternoon together.
