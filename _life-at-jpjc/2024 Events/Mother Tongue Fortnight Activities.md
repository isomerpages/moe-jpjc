<h5><b>Mother Tongue Fortnight 2024</b></h5>

<p>As part of our college's continuous effort to promote students’ joy of learning and appreciation of their Mother Tongue languages and culture, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department planned a series of activities for Mother Tongue Fortnight (MTF) in Term 2 Weeks 2 and 4.</p>

<p>The MTL department tailored these activities to provide authentic experiential opportunities for students to engage with their Mother Tongue languages, thereby strengthening their sense of connection and cultural identity.</p>

   
<h5><b>Cultural aspect of MTF</b></h5>	
<p>During the first week of MTF, the inaugural music sharing event, Xin Kong Xia (新空下), took place at the Jurong Pioneer Junior College auditorium, captivating approximately 450 Chinese students with the allure of Xinyao songs. Meanwhile, our Malay students delved into the art of Batik printing, immersing themselves in a hands-on cultural experience to deepen their understanding of Malay heritage. Likewise, our Tamil students participated in a Poetry and Fables appreciation workshop, integrating drama skills and game strategies to make language learning an enjoyable and engaging experience.</p>

<h5><b>Language aspect of MTF</b></h5>

<p>Furthermore, the Chinese, Malay and Tamil units of the MTL department collaborated to create a quiz segment focusing on topics relevant to the practical use of Mother Tongue languages. Utilising the Loquiz app, students engaged in a gamified quiz experience centred around Culture, Environment, and Technology. During the second week of MTF, three game sessions were organised where students worked in groups to unlock quiz segments by scanning QR codes scattered across the college premises.</p>

<p>In addition to the Loquiz activity, six classes of Chinese students participated in a detective game titled, “Who is the one?” (谁是推理王), where they collaborated&nbsp; as a team to solve a simulated crime scene set up in Multi-purpose Room 2. The intricate crime scenes challenged students to apply critical thinking skills to unravel the mystery.</p>

<p>Finally, MTF concluded with a writing competition aimed at encouraging students to practise creative writing in their Mother Tongue languages. Top winners of the competition were awarded gift vouchers as recognition and encouragement for their dedication to mastering their Mother Tongue languages.</p>

<p>Overall, MTF was a fortnight filled with laughter, learning, and a deeper appreciation for the diverse tapestry of languages and cultures that enrich our college community.
