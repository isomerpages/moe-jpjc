<p>The “Xin Kong Xia” (XKX) National Schools Xinyao Festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year! This annual music extravaganza for students has been jointly organised by our college, in collaboration with the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), TCR Music Station and Lianhe Zaobao since 2015. This year’s festival was hosted at our college premises, marking the commencement of the Xinyao Appreciation Series. The Guest of Honour was Ms. Gan Siow Huang, Minister of State for MOE &amp; MOM, and Chairman of CPCLL.</p>
<p>The Xinyao Appreciation Series showcased winning original compositions from previous editions of the XKX National Schools Songwriting Competition, alongside classic Xinyao songs. A 500-strong audience, comprising esteemed guests and students, embarked on a nostalgic journey through Singapore’s Xinyao development during the inaugural Xinyao Music Appreciation session on 27 March 2024. They relished live music performances and a multimedia presentation, immersing themselves in the rich tapestry of Xinyao culture.  </p>

<p>In a Lianhe Zaobao interview, our students shared their newfound appreciation for Xinyao. Sam Xin Hui, previously unfamiliar with Xinyao, gained insight into its heritage during the appreciation session. She particularly resonated with the lyrics of the winning song “The Summer That Year” from the 2023 competition. On the other hand, Sara Ong Xiping, already acquainted with Xinyao, was impressed by the performers’ professionalism and the emotional depth conveyed through the songs.</p>

<p>In closing, Mr Lee Eng Seng, a senior teacher from the MTL department, expressed hope for Xinyao to serve as a platform for the Chinese language to extend beyond the confines of classroom walls. He believed that Xinyao songs could offer students a medium to express their emotions, thereby encouraging them to incorporate the language into their daily live rather than limiting it to textbooks.
