<p>Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) held our #WhyJP Open House on 12 January 2024, welcoming approximately 2000 visitors to the college. Aligned with the sub-theme, ‘Nurturing Seeds of Tomorrow’, our students and staff provided visitors insight into how an education at JPJC promotes and facilitates growth and learning. Visitors witnessed our vibrant student culture, experienced our conducive environment, and felt the warmth of our JP family, empowering them to make informed decisions regarding college selection and subject combinations.</p>

<p>At the #WhyJP Open House, our Principal, Mr Kevin Ang, shared with visitors why they should choose JPJC for their junior college journey, emphasising the quality education and wide variety of programmes offered for holistic development. In the Hall, visitors learnt about the JC curriculum and assessment formats through the Academic and Subject Combination Showcase, with teachers available to address queries. Mother Tongue Languages teachers were also present to provide expert knowledge on the Chinese and Malay Language Elective Programmes, signature offerings  at JPJC. Special Programmes and Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) booths in the Concourse, Hall, and Canteen gave visitors insight into the holistic education and varied CCA opportunities available. Dynamic performances by various Performing Arts CCAs not only showcased talents but also served as an inspiring glimpse into the vibrant extracurricular opportunities awaiting prospective students who choose JPJC as their college of choice. These performances encouraged visitors to explore their interests and envision themselves as part of #JPFam.</p>
