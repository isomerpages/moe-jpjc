<p>Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) held our #WhyJP Open House on 12
January 2024, welcoming approximately 2000 visitors to the college. Aligned
with the sub-theme, ‘Nurturing Seeds of Tomorrow’, our students and staff
provided visitors insight into how an education at JPJC promotes and facilitates
growth and learning. Visitors witnessed our vibrant student culture, experienced
our conducive environment, and felt the warmth of our JP family, empowering
them to make informed decisions regarding college selection and subject
combinations.</p>

<p>At the #WhyJP Open House, our Principal, Mr Kevin Ang, shared with visitors
why they should choose JPJC for their junior college journey, emphasising
the quality education and wide variety of programmes offered for holistic
development. In the Hall, visitors learnt about the JC curriculum and assessment
formats through the Academic and Subject Combination Showcase, with teachers
available to address queries. Mother Tongue Languages teachers were also
present to provide expert knowledge on the Chinese and Malay Language Elective
Programmes, signature offerings&nbsp; at JPJC. Special Programmes and Co-Curricular
Activities (CCA) booths in the Concourse, Hall, and Canteen gave visitors
insight into the holistic education and varied CCA opportunities available.
Dynamic performances by various Performing Arts CCAs not only showcased
talents but also served as an inspiring glimpse into the vibrant extracurricular
opportunities awaiting prospective students who choose JPJC as their college
of choice. These performances encouraged visitors to explore their interests
and envision themselves as part of #JPFam.</p>
<p>The palpable energy and vibrancy of JPJC college life made the #WhyJP

alike.</p>
