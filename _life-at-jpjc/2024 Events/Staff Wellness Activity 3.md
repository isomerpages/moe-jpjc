<p>We are excited to showcase the thoughtful endeavours of our JPJC students, who are embracing values of growth, love, and possibilities. Recently, they volunteered to support our teachers and non-teaching staff during the Term Two Staff Wellness Activity by sharing insights gained from their various Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and enrichment programmes.</p>

<p>From CCAs like the Chinese Cultural Society and JP Dance Club, to enrichment programmes such as the STEAM and Chemistry interest groups, our students have been immersing themselves in diverse learning experiences during their two years here at JPJC. Now, they are extending their journey to enrich our educators, fostering a supportive environment for all involved.</p>

<p>This exchange of knowledge not only benefits our teachers but also encourages our students to share their insights with the broader community, promoting a sense of cooperation. It exemplifies the caring atmosphere within our JPJC family, where everyone contributes to mutual progress and well-being.</p>

<p>As we celebrate these moments of growth, love, and possibilities, let us recognise the kindness and dedication of our students. Together, we are shaping a future enriched with learning opportunities and meaningful connections.
