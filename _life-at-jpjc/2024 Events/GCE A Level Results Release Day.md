<p>Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) warmly welcomed back its fifth cohort of students for the release of the 2023 GCE A-Level Examination results on 23rd February. Our hearts swelled with joy at the sight of our former students reuniting and reconnecting with their teachers and peers. The college hall hummed with excitement as eager parents joined us to support their children. Alongside our JC2 students, who cheered enthusiastically for their seniors, the hall overflowed with energy and anticipation.</p>
<p>Addressing the Class of 2023, Principal Mr. Kevin Ang extended his heartfelt congratulations on their successful completion of their JC journey. He shared an inspiring quote from Winston Churchill, “Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” Mr. Ang encouraged them to embrace the future with confidence, emphasising the importance of looking beyond A-Levels and pursuing infinite possibilities.</p>
<p>Mr. Ang highlighted a notable increase in the number of students achieving outstanding results in the A-Levels, while also showcasing holistic achievements in line with the college's mission of fostering active learners, innovative thinkers, and compassionate leaders. He emphasised that regardless of their diverse starting points in terms of L1R5 and their secondary school backgrounds, their success was both attainable and commendable. Applause filled the hall as Mr. Ang invited the top achievers to stand among their peers. At this moment, one could observe proud teachers and parents cheering enthusiastically too.</p>
<p>In his closing address, Mr. Ang emphasised the profound impact of the unwavering support and guidance provided to the Class of 2023 by their teachers, parents, and peers. He encouraged them to openly express gratitude for these invaluable contributions. Mr. Ang expressed his hope that the graduates will uphold the values of JPJC and embody the essence of the JPFam ethos – ‘While I Live, I Learn, Plus Ultra’ – as they embark on their future endeavours. Congratulations to the Class of 2023 for their remarkable achievements!</p>
