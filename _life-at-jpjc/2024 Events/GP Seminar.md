<p>On February 7, 2024, students and faculty gathered for an enlightening
General Paper seminar featuring Mr. He Ruiming, co-founder of The Woke
Salaryman. With a mission to empower individuals with financial literacy
and life wisdom, Mr. He engaged students with his insightful perspectives
on pathways, decision-making, and using wealth for personal and societal
betterment.</p>
<p>The highlight of the event was an authentic Q&amp;A session where students
had the opportunity to ask Mr. He anything about adulting. Led by the Head
of English, Ms. Sarizah and GP tutor Ms. Thandar, the unscripted dialogue
session presented a genuine exchange between the J2 students and speaker,
providing the audience with invaluable insights on navigating the complexities
of adulthood.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. He's candid responses, coupled with his personal struggles
and life experience, captivated the audience, sparking meaningful discussions
and reflections. His alternative viewpoints on life resonated with students
as many students felt that Mr He’s experiences were ‘very real’.</p>
<p>We extend our gratitude to Mr. He Ruiming for sharing his wisdom and to
all participants for their active engagement. As we continue on our journeys,
may we apply these learnings to forge brighter futures for ourselves and
our communities.</p>
