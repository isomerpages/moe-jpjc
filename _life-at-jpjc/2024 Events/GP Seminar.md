<p>On February 7, 2024, students and faculty gathered for an enlightening
General Paper seminar featuring Mr. He Ruiming, co-founder of The Woke
Salaryman. With a mission to empower individuals with financial literacy
and life wisdom, Mr. He engaged students with his insightful perspectives
on pathways, decision-making, and using wealth for personal and societal
betterment.</p>
<p>The highlight of the event was an authentic Q&amp;A session where students
had the opportunity to ask Mr. He anything about adulting. Led by the Head
of English, Ms. Sarizah and GP tutor Ms. Thandar, the unscripted dialogue
session presented a genuine exchange between the J2 students and speaker,
providing the audience with invaluable insights on navigating the complexities
of adulthood.</p>
