<p>On February 15, 2024, our college conducted the TD40 Exercise SG Ready - Energy Disruption simulation exercise, ensuring a balance of realism and safety for our students and staff. The exercise began with the activation of the fire alarm, prompting all personnel to assemble in the hall. Subsequently, the college was informed of an energy disruption, resulting in the power supply being cut off. </p>

<p>After accounting for all personnel, students and staff returned to their classrooms to continue their lessons under conditions of no power supply, including no lights, fans, or air-conditioning, and without WIFI connection. Teachers had to adapt their lessons as they were unable to use projectors, and students experienced inconvenience and discomfort due to the disruption. </p>

<p>At the conclusion of the exercise, students and teachers convened to share their learning experiences during the post-exercise civics lesson. Through the exercise and accompanying lessons, our students learnt how to respond to disruptions and engaged in conversations with their peers and civic tutors on the roles they could play in the community and the nation to overcome such challenges. Together, we contribute to keeping Singapore strong!</p>
