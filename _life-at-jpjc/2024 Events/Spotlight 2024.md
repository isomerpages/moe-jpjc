<p>The first term of 2024 concluded in a remarkable crescendo, marked by JPJC's signature event, JP Spotlight! The theme for this year's annual in-house talent competition was 'Press Start!', paying homage to all things Y2K - from music, fashion to computer bugs. Over the course of approximately one month, the Student Planning Committee, orchestrated a captivating and meaningful Spotlight experience under the guidance of Ms. Ana and Mdm. Shamala.</p>

<p>The array of talents showcased at this year's Spotlight was nothing short of impressive. From electrifying dance routines to heartfelt serenades, and culminating with the enchanting melodies of the harp, all the performances during the afternoon left an indelible mark on the audience. Judging such diverse and exceptional talents proved to be a formidable challenge for the panel, which consisted of Mr. Nah Hong Leong (Vice-Principal), Ms. Ong Hui Wen (Assistant Year Head), Mr. Matthew Quek, and Mikayla, a JPJC alumna and one of the winners of JP Spotlight 2023. </p>

<p>After a gruelling battle of talents, ‘Boss B’, a dance ensemble featuring Cirie Koh (23A02), Iris Yeo (23A02), and Angel Lim (23A08), were crowned as champions. Their dance performance, set to Y2K song medleys, was irresistibly catchy and captivating. SNAP, the band that infused their performance with Y2K Indie Vibes, claimed the first runner-up title. The dynamic collaboration of Sean Tan (23A03), Lim Huiwen (23A05), Sherman Chua (23S08), Lim Junwei (23S08), and Caspar Liew (24S08) captivated the judges with their vibrant symphony. The second runner-up title and Audience Choice Award went to another heart-thumping dance performance by the Powerpuff Girls - made up of Ummu Kalthum (23A04), Valyn Ang (24S03) and Felice Leong (24S06). </p>

<p>A standout segment of Spotlight 2024 was undoubtedly the intermissions - kicking off with a TikTok Dance Battle between teachers and students. The atmosphere was filled with intense competition, culminating in a tie for the prestigious Top TikToker Award shared by Mr. Koh Chit Siong and Joson See (23A03). The second intermission featured a special performance by the "Unknowns," comprising Y2K veterans - Mr Azri, Mr Sufian, Mr John Yeo, Mr Steve Poh, Mr Lim Chin Kuan and Mr Yap Lok Hun -  who treated us to renditions of two popular Y2K hit songs!</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, Spotlight 2024 was brimming with adrenaline and high energy as both staff and students delved into the nostalgic blast from the past. The countdown for Spotlight 2025 begins…
