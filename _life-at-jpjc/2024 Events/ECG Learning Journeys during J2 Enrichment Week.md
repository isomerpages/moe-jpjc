<p>As part of our college’s commitment to enhancing our students’ overall
school experience, the Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Committee organised
learning journeys to Institutions of Higher Learning and industries during
the J2 Enrichment Week in February. These excursions provided valuable
insights into university admission criteria and campus life through the
guided tours and sample lectures. Similarly, visits to various industries
offered our students enriching insights into real-world operations and
cutting-edge technologies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From exploring the intricacies of cybersecurity at Singtel Cybersecurity
Institute to witnessing medical advancements at Alexandra Hospital, each
industry visit broadened our students’ perspectives and sparked their curiosity.
These immersive experiences not only provided a glimpse into various career
paths but also equipped our students with practical knowledge and skills
essential for their future endeavours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The impact of these learning journeys extends far beyond the classroom,
empowering our students to make informed decisions and navigate their academic
and professional journeys with confidence.</p>
