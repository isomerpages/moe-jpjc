<p>More than two thousand prospective students and parents streamed into our JP campus on Friday, 16
January 2026, for a day of exploration and discovery. The Open House brought to life JPJC's dynamic campus culture 🏫, comprehensive academic pathways 📚, and vibrant array of CCAs 🎶⚽— a true reflection of what makes JPJC a great place to learn and grow.</p>
	
<p>Our welcoming student leaders😊led visitors on guided tours around the campus, offering insights along the way. Both the hall and canteen were filled with interactive subject, programme, and CCA showcases, giving guests the chance to explore a wide range of co-curricular options up close. Meanwhile, energetic performances at the concourse 🎭🎤infused the day with excitement and captured the vibrant spirit of the school.</p>
