<p>JPJC develops studentsâ€™ self-regulation skills to encourage greater awareness and ownership of their own growth, in pursuit of short-term and long-term goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The JPJC Self-Regulation Framework comprises three aspects: (i) daily routines (ii) self-care and (iii) learning habits.
</p>

<p><strong>Daily routines:</strong></p>

<p>*   What is the daily routine that I have to put in place to achieve my short-term and long-term goals?</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;*   How can I plan, and allocate time realistically, for my academic studies, CCA, family and other interests?</p>
		
<p>&emsp;&emsp;*   How can I ensure that I commit effectively to this plan?</P>
	
	
<p><strong>Learning habits:</strong></p>

<p>*   What are the good learning habits that I have to put in place to achieve my short-term and long-term goals?</p>
 <p>&emsp;&emsp;*   Do I know effective subject-specific study skills?</p>
	
<p><strong>Self-care:</strong></p>

<p>*   How can I take care of myself?</p>
    
<p>&emsp;&emsp;*   What are my physical, intellectual, emotional &amp; social needs?</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;*   What do I need to pay more attention to?</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;	*   How can I get myself to be more mindful?</p>
