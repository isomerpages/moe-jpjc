<p>JPJC develops students’ self-regulation skills to encourage greater awareness and ownership of their own growth, in pursuit of short-term and long-term goals. </p>

<p>The JPJC Self-Regulation Framework comprises three aspects: (i) daily routines (ii) self-care and (iii) learning habits.
</p>

<p><strong>Daily routines:</strong>

*   What is the daily routine that I have to put in place to achieve my short-term and long-term goals?</P>
	<p>*   How can I plan, and allocate time realistically, for my academic studies, CCA, family and other interests? </p>
   	<p>*   How can I ensure that I commit effectively to this plan?</p>
	
<P><strong>Learning habits:</strong>

*   What are the good learning habits that I have to put in place to achieve my short-term and long-term goals?</P>
    <p>*   Do I know effective subject-specific study skills?</P>
	
<p><strong>Self-care:</strong>

*   How can I take care of myself?</P>
    
	<p>*   What are my physical, intellectual, emotional & social needs? </P>
    <p>*   What do I need to pay more attention to?</P>
    <p>	*   How can I get myself to be more mindful?</p>
