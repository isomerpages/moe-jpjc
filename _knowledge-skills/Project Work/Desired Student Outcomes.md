<p>
<strong>Creative and Critical Thinking Skills</strong> - Students will be equipped to generate creative ideas for their own project topics. Critical thinking skills will also be developed through analyzing and evaluating ideas independently.</p>

<p>
<strong>Communication Skills</strong> - Both oral and written communication skills will be learnt in an informal setting. This is done through workshops as well as oral presentations conducted throughout the year. Teachers and students work closely to further improve on these skills.</p>

<p>
<strong>Collaborative Learning</strong> - Teamwork plays an important role in project work as students are expected to work in groups. Team-building activities and focus group discussions will be central in ensuring that learning is effective.</p>

<p>	
<strong>Self-directed Inquiry</strong> - Students will also be equipped with the necessary skills to conduct independent research on their topics. The research methods include obtaining and evaluating information from secondary sources as well as knowledge about conducting primary research (online and written surveys, and interviews, etc).</p>
