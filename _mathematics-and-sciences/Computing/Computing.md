<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p><center><i>
“…we must get our children in schools exposed to IT, exposed to programming.., we must expose our kids and enable the most talented and interested ones to be able to go far and develop their talent in IT in schools to make a Smart Nation…”<br>
	~ Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong</i></center></p>

Computing is a beautiful story of the amalgamation of vision, passion, innovation, creativity, serendipity, fuelled by an unwillingness to accept the limits of the human minds and bodies. From the abacus to the tablet PCs, encyclopedia to wikipedia, paper maps to google map, there have been significant advancements in technology to allow us to make use of computers to count the uncountable, to experience beyond our own experiences, and to witness the unbelievable and unforeseeable.</p>

The fast-moving, exciting world of computing is highly competitive but we endeavour to provide our students with an edge when it comes to university admission and eventually job employment.</p>
