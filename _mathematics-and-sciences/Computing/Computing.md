“We owe it to our students to give them access to technology, computational thinking, and creative problem-solving — so that those with the passion and aptitude can take their talents further and contribute meaningfully to our society.”</i></center><p></p>

<p>Computing at Jurong Pioneer Junior College is about nurturing curiosity, creativity, and problem-
solving.</p>

<p>In a world shaped by Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, and digital innovation, we prepare our
students with strong foundations in programming and computational thinking. At the same time,
we develop essential 21st-century skills such as communication, collaboration, and resilience.</p>

<p>Our goal is to empower students to become future-ready, and responsible learners who can contribute meaningfully to Singapore’s digital future.</p>

“…we must get our children in schools exposed to IT, exposed to programming.., we must expose our kids and enable the most talented and interested ones to be able to go far and develop their talent in IT in schools to make a Smart Nation…”<br>

<p>
Computing is a beautiful story of the amalgamation of vision, passion, innovation, creativity, serendipity, fuelled by an unwillingness to accept the limits of the human minds and bodies. </p>

<p>
The fast-moving, exciting world of computing is highly competitive but we endeavour to develop cognitive skills in students, as well as 21CC (such as communication, collaboration, self-efficacy) that will help adapt to advancements in the field of computing and global changes impacting the workplace and society.</p></div></div>
