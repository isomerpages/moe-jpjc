The H2 Computing Curriculum provides students with a broad understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles of computing, and a systemic understanding of how hardware and software work together in computing solutions.</p>
	
<p>
Students will be exposed to authentic real-world contexts through hands-on practical assignments and projects in the realisation of computer programs from algorithms. They will learn algorithm design and programming skills as a critical element of developing higher-order thinking skills. Opportunities are created for students to develop 21st Century competencies such as inventive thinking, perseverance, collaboration and communication, through the lessons and enrichment programmes.</p>

<p>	
Through these learning experiences, the subject will provide a broad-based foundation for further studies in computing and other related fields.</p>
