### **Curriculum**
The H2 Computing Curriculum provides students with a broad understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles of computing, and a systemic understanding of how hardware and software work together in computing solutions.

Students will be exposed to authentic real-world contexts through hands-on practical assignments and projects in the realisation of computer programs from algorithms. They will learn algorithm design and programming skills as a critical element of developing higher-order thinking skills. Opportunities are created for students to develop 21st Century competencies such as inventive thinking, perseverance, collaboration and communication, through the lessons and enrichment programmes.

Through these learning experiences, the subject will provide a broad-based foundation for further studies in computing and other related fields.
