### **Syllabus & Assessment**
#### **H1 CHEMISTRY (8873)**
H1 Chemistry aims to develop scientific literacy in our students through the acquisition of core chemistry knowledge and scientific thinking. This includes **developing an understanding of the skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the practices of science**. In particular, the syllabus aims to develop in students the ability to navigate Chemistry between macroscopic phenomena, submicroscopic interactions and symbolic representations to **communicate** and explain the natural world.

The key features of the H1 Chemistry Curriculum comprise Core Ideas and Extension Topics, Practices of Science and Learning Experiences, as illustrated in the diagram below.

_Content map for H1 Chemistry_

Candidates will be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of Chemistry at O-Level as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course. This syllabus is designed to place less emphasis on factual material and greater emphasis on the understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles.

Candidates may not simultaneously offer Chemistry H1 and H2 levels.

| Paper | Type of Paper | Duration | Marks | Weighting |
|:---:|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Multiple Choice | 1 h | 30 | 33% |
| 2 | Structured and Free Response | 2 h | 80 | 67% |
|

**Paper 1** (1 h, 30 marks)<br>
This paper consists of 30 compulsory multiple choice questions. Four to six items will be of the multiple completion type.<br>
All questions will include 4 options.

**Paper 2** (2 h, 80 marks)<br>
This paper consists of two sections:<br>
**Section A** (60 marks)<br>
 A variable number of structured questions including data-based questions, all compulsory. The data-based question(s) constitute(s) 15\-20 marks for this paper. The data-based question(s) provide(s) a good opportunity to test higher order thinking skills such as handling, applying and evaluating information.<br>
**Section B** (20 marks)<br>
Candidates will be required to answer **one** out of two questions. Each question will carry 20 marks. These questions will require candidates to integrate knowledge and understanding from different areas and topics of the chemistry syllabus<br>

#### **H2 CHEMISTRY (9729)**
H2 Chemistry aims to develop students’ understanding of the chemical concepts and how these concepts are related within chemistry and to other science discipline. A key feature in the study of H2 Chemistry is the development of students’ ability to navigate between macroscopic phenomena, microscopic interactions and symbolic representation to **attain a deep conceptual understanding of the behaviours of chemical systems**.

It will enable students to extend this way of viewing and thinking about the behaviours of chemical systems to physical and biological phenomena, which are present in many aspects of daily life, e.g. environmental pollution and food science.
