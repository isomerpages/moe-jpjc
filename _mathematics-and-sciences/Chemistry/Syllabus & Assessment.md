### **Syllabus & Assessment**
#### **H1 CHEMISTRY (8873)**
<p align=justify>
H1 Chemistry aims to develop scientific literacy in our students through the acquisition of core chemistry knowledge and scientific thinking. This includes <strong>developing an understanding of the skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the practices of science</strong>. In particular, the syllabus aims to develop in students the ability to navigate Chemistry between macroscopic phenomena, submicroscopic interactions and symbolic representations to <strong>communicate</strong> and explain the natural world.
<p align=justify>
The key features of the H1 Chemistry Curriculum comprise Core Ideas and Extension Topics, Practices of Science and Learning Experiences, as illustrated in the diagram below.</p>

<p align=justify>
Candidates will be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of Chemistry at O-Level as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course. This syllabus is designed to place less emphasis on factual material and greater emphasis on the understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles.</p>
<p align=justify>
Candidates may not simultaneously offer Chemistry H1 and H2 levels.</p>

<div align=justify>
	<h5>Paper 1 (1 h, 30 marks)</h5>
This paper consists of 30 compulsory multiple choice questions. Four to six items will be of the multiple completion type.<br><br>
All questions will include 4 options.
<p>
	<h5>Paper 2 (2 h, 80 marks)</h5>
This paper consists of two sections:<br>

**Section A** (60 marks)<br>
 A variable number of structured questions including data-based questions, all compulsory. The data-based question(s) constitute(s) 15\-20 marks for this paper. The data-based question(s) provide(s) a good opportunity to test higher order thinking skills such as handling, applying and evaluating information.<br>
	
**Section B** (20 marks)<br>
Candidates will be required to answer **one** out of two questions. Each question will carry 20 marks. These questions will require candidates to integrate knowledge and understanding from different areas and topics of the chemistry syllabus<br><br>

#### **H2 CHEMISTRY (9729)**
H2 Chemistry aims to develop students’ understanding of the chemical concepts and how these concepts are related within chemistry and to other science discipline. A key feature in the study of H2 Chemistry is the development of students’ ability to navigate between macroscopic phenomena, microscopic interactions and symbolic representation to **attain a deep conceptual understanding of the behaviours of chemical systems**.

It will enable students to extend this way of viewing and thinking about the behaviours of chemical systems to physical and biological phenomena, which are present in many aspects of daily life, e.g. environmental pollution and food science.

#### **Syllabus Outline for H2 Chemistry**
The key features of the H2 Chemistry Curriculum comprise Core Ideas and Extension Topics, Practices of Science and Learning Experiences, as illustrated in the diagram below.

Candidates will be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of Chemistry at O-Level as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course. This syllabus is designed to place less emphasis on factual material and greater emphasis on the understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles. Experimental work is an important component and should underpin the teaching and learning of Chemistry.

#### **Assessment for H2 Chemistry**
All candidates are required to enter for Papers 1, 2 3 and 4.

| Paper | Type of Paper | Duration | Marks | Weighting |
|:---:|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Multiple Choice | 1 h | 30 | 15 |
| 2 | Structured Questions | 2 h | 75 | 30 |
| 3 | Free Response Questions | 2 h | 80 | 35 |
| 4 | Practical Paper | 2 h 30 min | 55 | 20 |
|

**Paper 1** (1 h, 30 marks)<br>
This paper consists of 30 compulsory multiple choice questions. Five to eight items will be of the multiple completion type.<br>
All questions will include 4 options.

**Paper 2** (2 h, 75 marks)<br>
This paper consists of a variable number of structured questions including data-based questions. All questions are compulsory and answered on the question paper. The data-based question(s) constitute(s) 20\-25 marks for this paper.<br>
The data-based question(s) provide(s) a good opportunity to test higher order thinking skills such as handling, applying and evaluating information. Some questions will also require candidates to integrate knowledge and understanding from different areas and topics of the chemistry syllabus.

**Paper 3** (2 h, 80 marks)<br>
This paper consists of two sections:<br>
*   **Section A** (60 marks) consists 3\-4 free response questions, all compulsory. Each question constitutes 15\-25 marks.<br>
*   **Section B** (20 marks) consists _two_ questions, each of 20 marks. Candidates are to answer any one question.<br>
These questions will require candidates to integrate knowledge and understanding from different areas and topics of the chemistry syllabus.

**Paper 4** (2 h 30 min, 55 marks)<br>
This paper will assess appropriate aspects of practical in the following skill areas:<br>
*   Planning (P)
*   Manipulation, measurement and observation (MMO)
*   Presentation of data and observations (PDO)
*   Analysis, conclusion and evaluation (ACE)
The assessment of Planning (P) will have a weighing of 5 %. The assessment of skill areas MMO, PDO and ACE will have a weighing of 15 %.<br>
The scope of the practical paper is indicated in the Practical Assessment section. The assessment of PDO and ACE may also include questions on data-analysis which do not require practical equipment and apparatus.

#### **H3 CHEMISTRY (9813)**
The H3 Chemistry framework is built on H2 Chemistry, anchored by the three Core Ideas – (1) Matter, (2) Structure and Properties, and (3) Transformation. Throughout the study of H3 Chemistry, explicit links will be made to the Core Ideas, deepening students’ understanding of their knowledge in these Core Ideas and the Practices of Science. Learning Experiences also feature prominently in H3 Chemistry to enhance students’ learning.

H3 Chemistry syllabus has been designed to build on and extend the knowledge, understanding and skills acquired from the H2 Chemistry (9729) syllabus. It caters to students of strong ability and keen interest in chemistry, and is **designed with a strong emphasis on independent and self–directed learning**. Students should simultaneously offer H2 Chemistry. The H3 Chemistry is meant to nurture students’ passion for the subject and **provide greater depth and rigour in the subject** for those pursuing further studies in chemistry–related fields.
