<h3><strong>H1 CHEMISTRY (8873)</strong></h3>
<div align="justify">
<p>H1 Chemistry aims to develop scientific literacy in our students through the acquisition of core chemistry knowledge and scientific thinking. This includes <b>developing an understanding of the skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the practices of science.</b> In particular, the syllabus aims to develop in students the ability to navigate Chemistry between macroscopic phenomena, submicroscopic interactions and symbolic representations to <b>communicate</b> and explain the natural world.</p>

<p>The key features of the H1 Chemistry Curriculum comprise Core Ideas and Extension Topics, Practices of Science and Learning Experiences, as illustrated in the diagram below.</p>

<figcaption>H1 Chemistry Curriculum Framework</figcaption></figure>

<p>The <i>Practices of Science</i> highlight the ways of thinking and doing that are inherent in the scientific approach, with the aim of equipping students with the understanding, skills, and attitudes shared by the scientific disciplines, including an appropriate approach to ethical issues.<br>
The content in the H1 Chemistry syllabus are organised into two levels:
</p>
	
<li><b>Core Ideas</b><br>
There are three core ideas, namely Matter, Structure and Properties, and Transformation, which are fundamental in the study of Chemistry. Concepts in these core ideas are inter-related and form the basis for which further learning and understanding of chemical phenomena and reactions is built upon.</li>

<li><b> Extension Topic</b><br>
Concepts in the core ideas are applied to real-world context in the study of Polymers and Organic Chemistry.</li>

<p>Candidates will be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of Chemistry at O-Level as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course. This syllabus is designed to place less emphasis on factual material and greater emphasis on the understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles.</p>
<p>Candidates may not simultaneously offer Chemistry H1 and H2 levels.</p>

<h4><strong>Paper 1&nbsp;(1 h, 30 marks)</strong></h4>
<p>This paper consists of 30 compulsory multiple choice questions. Four to six items will be of the multiple completion type.<br>
All questions will include 4 options.</p>

<h4><strong>Paper 2&nbsp;(2 h, 80 marks)</strong></h4>
<p>This paper consists of two sections. All answers will be written in spaces provided on the Question Paper.</p><br>

<h5><strong>Section A (60 marks)</strong></h5>
<p>A variable number of structured questions including data-based questions, all compulsory. The data-based question(s) constitute(s) 15–20 marks for this paper. The data-based question(s) provide(s) a good opportunity to test higher order thinking skills such as handling, applying, and evaluating information.</p>
	
<h5><strong>Section B&nbsp;(20 marks)</strong></h5>
<p>Candidates will be required to answer <b>one</b> out of two questions. Each question will carry 20 marks.<br>
These questions will require candidates to integrate knowledge and understanding from different areas and topics of the chemistry syllabus.</p>

</p><h3><strong>H2 CHEMISTRY (9476)</strong></h3>
<p>
H2 Chemistry aims to develop students’ understanding of the chemical concepts and how these concepts are related within chemistry and to other science discipline. A key feature in the study of H2 Chemistry is the development of students’ ability to navigate between macroscopic phenomena, microscopic interactions and symbolic representation to <b>attain a deep conceptual understanding of the behaviours of chemical systems.</b></p>

<p>It will enable students to extend this way of viewing and thinking about the behaviours of chemical systems to physical and biological phenomena, which are present in many aspects of daily life, e.g. environmental pollution and food science.</p>

<h4><strong>Syllabus Outline for H2 Chemistry</strong></h4>
<p>
The key features of the H2 Chemistry Curriculum comprise Core Ideas and Extension Topics, Practices of Science and Learning Experiences, as illustrated in the diagram below.</p>

<figure>
<img src="/images/Curriculum/Chemistry/ChemFramework.jpg">
<figcaption>H2 Chemistry Curriculum Framework</figcaption></figure>

<li><b>Core Ideas</b><br>
There are three core ideas, namely Matter, Structure and Properties, and Transformation, which are fundamental in the study of Chemistry. Concepts in these core ideas are inter-related and form the basis for which further learning and understanding of chemical phenomena and reactions is built upon.</li>

<li><b> Extension Topic</b><br>
Concepts in the core ideas extend into the learning of different chemical systems such as the chemistry of organic compounds, including polymers, the chemistry of aqueous solutions, electrochemistry, and the chemistry of transition elements. As an example, an understanding of concepts of Chemical Bonding and The Periodic Table is extended to the study of the Chemistry of Transition Elements where students learn to appreciate the similarity and differences when comparing with main group metals.</li>

<p>Organising the content through the two levels highlights the importance of conceptual understanding in core ideas and how they extend to different chemical systems.</p>

<h3><strong>H3 CHEMISTRY (9813)</strong></h3>
<p>
The H3 Chemistry framework is built on H2 Chemistry, anchored by the three Core Ideas – (1) Matter, (2) Structure and Properties, and (3) Transformation. Throughout the study of H3 Chemistry, explicit links will be made to the Core Ideas, deepening students’ understanding of their knowledge in these Core Ideas and the Practices of Science. Learning Experiences also feature prominently in H3 Chemistry to enhance students’ learning.</p>
<p>
H3 Chemistry syllabus has been designed to build on and extend the knowledge, understanding and skills acquired from the H2 Chemistry (9729) syllabus. It caters to students of strong ability and keen interest in chemistry, and is&nbsp;<strong>designed with a strong emphasis on independent and self–directed learning</strong>. Students should simultaneously offer H2 Chemistry. The H3 Chemistry is meant to nurture students’ passion for the subject and&nbsp;<strong>provide greater depth and rigour in the subject</strong>&nbsp;for those pursuing further studies in chemistry–related fields.</p>
