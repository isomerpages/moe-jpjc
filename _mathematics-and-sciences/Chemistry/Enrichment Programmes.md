### **Enrichment Programmes**
In line with the college’s direction for the STEM Programme, the Department seeks to provide opportunities for students to maximise their potential and recognise their unique characteristics, in preparation for a possible future in STEM-related careers. Through purposefully curated activities based on Treffinger’s Levels of Service Framework (Awareness, Experience & Experimentation, Performance and Leadership), students are able to apply what they have learnt to authentic situations and, develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

#### **STEM Week**
In 2018, a group of interested students participated in the Fuel Cell workshop conducted by Singapore Science Centre. During the workshop, the students learnt about different fuel cell technologies and they also experimented with a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell and determine how efficient it is in converting hydrogen fuel into electrical energy, and how efficiently hydrogen fuel is generated by electrolysis.
