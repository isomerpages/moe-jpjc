<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>
The purpose of learning mathematics at the A-level is two-fold. Firstly, it provides students, regardless of the intended course of study at the university, with a useful set of tools and problem solving skills to support their tertiary study. Secondly, learning mathematics expose students to a way of thinking that complements other ways of thinking developed through the other disciplines. This contributes to the development of a well-rounded individual who is able to think deeply, broadly and differently about problems and issues.</p>

In Jurong Pioneer Junior College, the teachers in the Mathematics department are caring, engaging, and dedicated to sharing their knowledge of the subject and helping students to achieve personal excellence.</p></div>
