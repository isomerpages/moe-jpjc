<h3><strong>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO)</strong></h3>
<div align=justify>
<p>
The SMO is the largest and oldest mathematics competition in Singapore. Each year, thousands of students from all over the country take part in SMO. In Jurong Pioneer Junior College, we nominate students who have displayed outstanding aptitude for the subject to undergo at least 4 training sessions to prepare them for the competition. Through the rigour of the training programme, we aim to expose our students to abstract Mathematics and foster critical thinking amongst them.

<h3><strong>Australian Mathematics Competition (AMC)</strong></h3>
<p>
The AMC was introduced in Australia in 1978 as the first Australia-wide mathematics competition for students. It has become the largest single event on the Australian education calendar, allowing students to attempt the same tasks on the same day in over 30 countries around the globe. In Jurong Pioneer Junior College, we open the competition to all interested students and provide training to enhance their problem solving skills.</p>

<h3><strong>STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)</strong></h3>
<p>
STEM education is needed to fuel innovation and maintain competitiveness in our Singapore’s knowledge based economy.  A myriad of opportunities is provided for students of Jurong Pioneer Junior College to discover, develop and excel in their STEM interests and passion.</p>

<p>
We organise Mathematics talks by renowned academics to raise students’ awareness in how mathematics is applied in the real world, including the Arts. Learning journeys to Dialogue with Nobel Laureates and NUS math department are also organised to inspire students and provide clarity for their career choices in various STEM fields. In these learning journeys, students are exposed to real world problem topics of wavelets, coding theory and cryptography.

<p>
Students’ interests and curiosity in Mathematics and Computing are also fostered through interest group activities. Students will be engaged in guided and open inquiry activities to develop math problem solving and computational thinking dispositions. Selected students will also be afforded opportunities to engage in Math and Computing research projects. In 2017 and 2018, these projects were selected as finalists for the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair. Students in the interest group will also be involved in organising college-wide Math related activities, such as Pi-Day, and during the college's STEM Day to share their interest in the subject.

In 2018, our students also played their part in raising public awareness and interest in Mathematics through the _Festival of Numbers_ Activities at the Singapore Science Centre. Our students’ joyful interaction with the young children at the mathematics puzzles and games station was both meaningful and heartwarming.</p>

These programmes are part of our Talent and Leadership Development efforts to strengthen our STEM educational pipelines. Consequently, it is hoped that our students can have the long term commitment to become highly skilled STEM professionals that contribute towards Singapore’s economic vitality.</p>
