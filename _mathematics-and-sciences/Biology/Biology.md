<p>
The department aims to cultivate a deep appreciation for biology, encouraging students to develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential for further studies and careers in life sciences. We aspire for students to become scientifically literate, prepared to navigate and contribute to the rapidly evolving scientific landscape of the 21st century.</p>
	
<p>
Our vision is for every biology student to gain proficiency in the Practices of Scienceâ€”understanding the nature of scientific knowledge, mastering inquiry skills, and connecting scientific principles to societal issues. These skills empower students to critically engage with biological topics and understand their impact on daily life.</p>

<p>Through exploring foundational questions about life and its sustainability, students will learn about biology at both cellular and molecular levels, making connections to larger biological systems. This experience not only stimulates curiosity but also fosters care and responsibility for local and global ecosystems.</p>
