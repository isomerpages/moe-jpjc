The department aims to instil in students a sense of appreciation and awe for the biological nature, as well as to inspire students to be prepared for Life Science-related courses at university and, consequently, careers that are related to this field.

We envision every biology students to develop the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the Practices of Scienceâ€”understanding the nature of scientific knowledge; demonstrating science inquiry skills; relating science and society.
