### **Syllabus & Assessment**
##### **Syllabus Outline**
Students reading Biology can choose from two levels of study: H1 or H2. Biology at H1 level covers a subsection of the H2 theoretical syllabus, but in equal depth. Biology at H2 level covers more topics than at H1, including a hands-on component in the form of experimental techniques for laboratory work.

The syllabus is divided into two parts, the core syllabus and the extension topics. The core syllabus explores the workings of life in the areas of cellular functions, cellular physiology and biochemistry, DNA and genomics together with its organisation and control, genetics of inheritance, genetics of virus and bacteria as well as biology evolution. The extension topics comprise of climate change and immunology.
