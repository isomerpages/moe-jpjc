Exciting learning journeys to Lee Kong Chian Natural Museum and Science Centre serve as experiential learning opportunities for our students. Students will learn beyond the classroom and laboratories, where we extend the teaching and learning to the field and higher institutions of learning and research.</p>
<p>
Students will also take part in competitions such as Singapore Biology Olympiad and LKCMedicine Anatomy Challenge that enrich their knowledge and expose them to higher order thinking. They also engage with local and overseas scientists to further enhance their scientific knowledge.</p>
