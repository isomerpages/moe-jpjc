<p>Exciting learning journeys to the Lee Kong Chian Natural Museum and Science Centre serve as experiential learning opportunities for our students. Teaching and learning are extended beyond the classroom and laboratories to the field and higher institutions of learning and research.</p>

<p>Selected students will also take part in competitions such as the Singapore Biology Olympiad and International Biomedical Quiz that enrich their knowledge and expose them to higher order thinking.</p>

<p>Most significantly, the Biology Interest Group is a unique in-house programme that provides opportunities for all Biology students - H2 and H1 students alike - to embark on a journey of discovery.</p>

<p>Teacher-designed activities ranging from DNA extraction to Viral Diagnostic Lab enable students to explore the discipline beyond the syllabus. These hands-on experiences are truly invaluable opportunities for experimentation, enabling students to appreciate the application of abstract concepts to real-life contexts.	</p>
