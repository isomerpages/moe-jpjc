<h3><strong>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO)</strong></h3>
<div align="justify">
<p>
The SMO is the largest and oldest mathematics competition in Singapore. Each year, thousands of students from all over the country take part in SMO. In Jurong Pioneer Junior College, we nominate students who have displayed outstanding aptitude for the subject to undergo at least 4 training sessions to prepare them for the competition. Through the rigour of the training programme, we aim to expose our students to abstract Mathematics and foster critical thinking amongst them.

<h3><strong>Australian Mathematics Competition (AMC)</strong></h3>
<p>
The AMC was introduced in Australia in 1978 as the first Australia-wide mathematics competition for students. It has become the largest single event on the Australian education calendar, allowing students to attempt the same tasks on the same day in over 30 countries around the globe. In Jurong Pioneer Junior College, we open the competition to all interested students and provide training to enhance their problem solving skills.</p>

<h3><strong> STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics</strong></h3>
<p>STEAM education is needed to fuel innovation and maintain competitiveness in our Singapore’s knowledge based economy.&nbsp; A myriad of opportunities is provided for students of Jurong Pioneer Junior College to discover, develop and excel in their STEAM interests and passion.</p>

<p>As part of the STEAM programme in our college, Pi Day is celebrated on March 14th each year to honor the mathematical constant π (pi). Student volunteers from the Math Interest Group organise events to engage the college in activities that highlight the significance of pi in geometry, physics, and various scientific disciplines. It's a day to appreciate the beauty of mathematics and its pervasive role in our understanding of the natural world.

<p>On the college’s annual STEAM Day, members of the Math Interest Group organise booths with hands-on experiences that showcase the exciting and practical applications of Mathematics. Through these activities, students understand how math seamlessly integrates with science, technology, engineering and the arts and inspire students a deeper interest in mathematical thinking within the context of broader interdisciplinary exploration. Consequently, it is hoped that our students can have the long term commitment to become highly skilled STEAM professionals that contribute towards Singapore’s economic vitality.	</p>
