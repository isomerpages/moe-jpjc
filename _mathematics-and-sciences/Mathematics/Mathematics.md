<p>The purpose of learning mathematics at the A-level is two-fold. Firstly,
it provides students, regardless of the intended course of study at the
university, with a useful set of tools and problem solving skills to support
their tertiary study. Secondly, learning mathematics expose students to
a way of thinking that complements other ways of thinking developed through
the other disciplines. This contributes to the development of a well-rounded
individual who is able to think deeply, broadly and differently about problems
and issues.</p>
<p>In Jurong Pioneer Junior College, the teachers in the Mathematics department
are caring, engaging, and dedicated to sharing their knowledge of the subject
and helping students to achieve personal excellence.</p></div>
