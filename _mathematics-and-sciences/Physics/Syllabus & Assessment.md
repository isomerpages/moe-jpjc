<h3><strong>H2 Physics 9478</strong></h3>
<div align="justify">
<p>
The syllabus has been designed to build on and extend the content coverage at 'O' level. Candidates will be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of Physics at 'O' level, either as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course.</p>

<p>
Candidates may not simultaneously offer Physics at H1 and H2 levels.</p>

<h4><strong>Curriculum Framework</strong></h4>

<p>
The&nbsp;<i><strong>Values</strong></i>,&nbsp;<i><strong>Ethics</strong></i>,&nbsp;<i><strong>Attitudes</strong></i>,&nbsp;<i><strong>the Practices of Science</strong></i>,&nbsp;<i><strong>the Disciplinary Content</strong></i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i><strong>Learning Experiences</strong></i>&nbsp;are put together in a framework (Figure 1) to guide the development of the A-Level Physics curriculum.</p>

<p>
The&nbsp;<i><strong>Practices of Science</strong></i>&nbsp;highlight the ways of thinking and doing that are inherent in the scientific approach, with the aim of equipping students with the understanding, skills, and attitudes shared by the scientific disciplines, including an appropriate approach to ethical issues.</p>

<p>
The&nbsp;<i><strong>Disciplinary Content</strong></i>&nbsp;is organised around conceptual strands that are explored in different contexts. This content is coherently developed with a consideration of conceptual progression and framed by&nbsp;<i><strong>Core Ideas in Physics</strong></i>&nbsp; to help students integrate knowledge and link concepts across different topics.</p>
	
<p>
The&nbsp;<i><strong>Values, Ethics, Attitudes</strong></i>&nbsp;undergird the study of science and the use of related knowledge and skills to make a positive contribution to humanity.</p>
	
<p>
The&nbsp;<i><strong>Learning Experiences</strong></i>&nbsp;refer to a range of learning opportunities that enhance students’ learning of physics. Real-world contexts can help illustrate the application of physics concepts and bring the subject to life. These&nbsp;<i><strong>Learning Experiences</strong></i>&nbsp;would include experimental (practical work) activities and ICT tools that can be used to build students’ understanding and model-making. The&nbsp;<i><strong>Learning Experiences</strong></i>&nbsp;are not meant to be prescriptive or exhaustive but serve as examples of the range of learning experiences that can enhance students’ learning of physics.</p>

<h5><strong>Paper 1 (1 h, 30 marks)</strong></h5>
<p>
This paper will consist of 30 compulsory multiple-choice questions. All questions will be of the direct choice type with 4 options.</p>

<h5><strong>Paper 2 (2 h, 75 marks)</strong></h5>
<p>
This paper will consist of a variable number of structured questions plus one or two data-based questions and will include questions which require candidates to integrate knowledge and understanding from different areas of the syllabus. All questions are compulsory and answers will be written in spaces provided on the Question Paper. The data-based question(s) will constitute 20-25 marks.</p>

<h5><strong>Paper 3 (2 h, 75 marks)</strong></h5>
<p>
This paper will consist of 2 sections and will include questions which require candidates to integrate knowledge and understanding from different areas of the syllabus. All answers will be written in spaces provided on the Question Paper.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Section A worth 55 marks will consist of a variable number of structured questions, all compulsory.</li>
	<li>Section B worth 20 marks consisting of a choice of one from two 20-mark questions.</li></ul>

<h5><strong>Paper 4 (2 h 30 min, 50 marks)</strong></h5>
<p>
This paper will assess appropriate aspects of objectives in the following skill areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Planning (P)</li>
	<li>Manipulation, measurement and observation (MMO)</li>
	<li>Presentation of data and observations (PDO)</li>
	<li>Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (ACE)</li></ul>

<p>
The assessment of Planning (P) will have a weighting of 4%. The assessment of skill areas MMO, PDO and ACE will have a weighting of 16%.</p>

<p>
The assessment of PDO and ACE may also include questions on data analysis which do not require practical equipment and apparatus. Candidates will be required to process and analyse data using spreadsheet software. All answers will be written in spaces provided on the Question Paper. Candidates will be allocated 1 h 15 min for access to apparatus and materials of each section.</p>

<p>
Candidates will not be permitted to refer to books and laboratory notebooks during the assessment.</p>
