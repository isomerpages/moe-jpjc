<p>The goal of physics is to understand how things work from first principles. It defines the motion, forces and energy of everyday experiences, and is at play everywhere. Courses in physics reveal the mathematical beauty of the universe at scales ranging from subatomic to cosmological. Studying physics strengthens quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills that are valuable in areas beyond physics. Walking, riding on public transport or using GPS or other applications on your phone all incorporate the laws of physics. Physics students are not bound by context. They think outside the box to come up with innovative solutions that may not previously have been considered. They are constantly challenged with the way of thinking with new concepts and ideas, which are crucial to development and evolution.</p>

<p>The department aims to instil in students a good sense of appreciation, problem-solving skills, ethics and attitudes aligned to the Practices of Science and 21st Century Competencies.</p>
