The JPJC Physics Department welcomes students with a curiosity for learning about the scientific and technological world they live in. The teachers will take them down a journey of inquiry and discovery through lectures, tutorial and practical sessions. We are committed to providing students with rich and unique learning experiences through the use of simulations, videos and real-life demonstrations. To further inspire a deeper interest in the subject, JPJC set up a physics demo lab (Feynman Lab) to provide students with authentic and hands-on learning to make concepts come alive.</p>
