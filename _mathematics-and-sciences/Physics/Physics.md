<p>Studying physics reveals the universeâ€™s beauty from first principles, explaining motion, forces, and energy that shape daily experiences. This subject strengthens skills in quantitative reasoning and problem-solving, valuable across disciplines. Engineers use physics to design safer vehicles and structures, while technologies like GPS and public transport rely on its principles. Beyond physics, analytical skills equip students for careers in finance, where physicists model markets, or in medicine, where MRI technology relies on nuclear physics. Physics encourages innovative, out-of-the-box thinking, essential for solving complex, evolving challenges.</p>

<p>The department aims to instil in students a good sense of appreciation, problem-solving skills, ethics and attitudes aligned to the Practices of Science and 21st Century Competencies.</p>
