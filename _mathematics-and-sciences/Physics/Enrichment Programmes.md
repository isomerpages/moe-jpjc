<p>  STEM Innovation Challenge is a STEM expo where student participants will present their&nbsp;innovative research and engineering design primarily via a poster and a prototype/proof of concept, and are assessed by an independent team of academics from various academic, research institutes and industry partners on the quality of the innovation and the impact of the work on the society. Team JPJC participated in the STEM Innovation Challenge and showcased an interdisciplinary project in environmental and coastal protection with a prototype, winning a Merit Award.	</p>
