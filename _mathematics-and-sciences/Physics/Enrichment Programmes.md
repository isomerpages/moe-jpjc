<p>The aims of Physics enrichment programmes align with fostering deep engagement in the Practices of Science, which encompass the essential ways of thinking and methodologies that underpin all natural sciences. These programmes seek to build student capabilities in critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and scientific inquiry across core physics domains such as Newtonian Mechanics, Thermal Physics, and Electricity and Magnetism. Enrichment activities offer hands-on experiences and real-world contexts that bridge theoretical understanding with practical applications, inspiring students to explore the breadth of physics knowledge and its interdisciplinary connections.</p>
	
<p><b>Experiential Learning</b>
<br>Physics experiential learning emphasises hands-on activities that engage students in practical applications of theoretical concepts. Using iOLab digital sensors, students conduct experiments that allow them to gather real-time data, enhancing their understanding of fundamental physics principles. Collaborative learning activities foster teamwork and critical thinking, as students work together to solve complex problems. Additionally, the integration of Microsoft Excel for data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation enables students to interpret their findings effectively, enhancing their quantitative reasoning skills. This approach not only deepens their conceptual understanding but also prepares them for future careers in science and technology.</p>
	
<p><b>STEAM Day</b>
<br>This flagship event features exciting project showcases and interactive activities designed to engage students in hands-on learning experiences. Organised by the STEAM Interest Group with support from the STEAM Committee, STEAM Day showcases a variety of student-led projects and innovative initiatives, including self-assembled vehicles powered by renewable energy, prototypes of future cities, and the creative applications of 3D printing, artificial intelligence and practical computing applications. STEAM challenges require students to create, assemble, and build. Students will tackle authentic challenges, create prototype solutions, and test and re-test their designs collaboratively. These projects weave methods from arts and design, so students learn creative thinking skills.</p>	

<p><b>STEM Innovation Challenge</b>
<br>In the Horizon Hydrogen Grand Prix Singapore, a team of JPJC students designed and assembled their radio-controlled race car, creating customised car parts and bodywork. Over four months, they explored renewable energy sources and hydrogen fuel cell technology while determining the efficiency of converting hydrogen into electrical energy. They also learned how to generate hydrogen through electrolysis, applying their knowledge to build and race their innovative fuel cell car, which enhanced their understanding of sustainable engineering principles.</p>	
	

<p><b>Engineering and Tech Programme Scholarship (ETPS)</b>
<br>The MOE Engineering and Tech Programme Scholarship (ETPS) supports students with a strong interest in engineering and technology, providing financial assistance and unique learning opportunities. Recipients gain exposure to advanced topics in engineering, technology, and innovation through work attachment/ internship programme, industry visits, and participate in the 1-week ETPS Flagship STEM workshop. This programme encourages scholars to deepen their skills and understanding in these fields, preparing them for further studies and careers in engineering and technology.

Scholarship recipients will also be strongly encouraged to participate in a hands-on engineering-related project or learning activity of studentâ€™s choice within the duration of the scholarship. Some examples include participation in the Engineering Innovation Challenge (EIC), Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) or equivalent.
