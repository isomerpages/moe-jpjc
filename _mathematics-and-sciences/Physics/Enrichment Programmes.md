<h3><strong>STEM Week</strong></h3>
<div align="justify">
<p>
STEM Week aims to&nbsp;promote and encourage students to consider Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) curriculum choices in university as well as for their future career choices. The development of STEM talents and expertise in Singapore has impact on Singapore’s economic development and national security. During the week, various workshops, learning journeys to institutes of higher learning and enrichment talks were organised.</p>

<h3><strong>NUS Physics Enrichment Camp and Visit to the NUS Science Demo Lab</strong></h3>
<p>
The enrichment camp promotes the understanding and appreciation of the different aspects of Physics through lectures, tours to teaching laboratories, hands-on activities and engaging Physics demonstrations. Students will have the opportunity to see and conduct experiments related to the interesting world of Physics and its applications. In addition, students get to meet and interact with NUS Physics undergraduates and researchers.</p>

<h3><strong>Overseas Math and Science Trip</strong></h3>
<p>
To enable our students to have a better understanding of different cultures and to be exposed to different ideas and thinking, the department organises a yearly Math and Science Overseas Trip. The itinerary will be specially planned to enable students to visit universities and companies that has a strong focus on STEM (Science, technology, Engineering and Mathematics).</p>

<h3><strong>Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF)</strong></h3>
<p>
Physics students with strong interest in Physics, and especially in research, will be given a chance to participate in the SSEF. The SSEF is a prestigious science research competition organised by MOE, A\*STAR and the Singapore Science Centre.&nbsp;Our students did us proud in the SSEF 2016 (Tay Chao Jie from 15S21 won the Silver Award) and SSEF 2018 (Jacqueline Png&nbsp;from 17S05 won the Merit Award).</p>

<h3><strong>SUTD Electric Vehicle Design Challenge 2019</strong></h3>
<p>
A team of 12 JC2 students took part in the Electric Vehicle Design Challenge organised by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). This is the first time that the college took part in this competition. The team worked tirelessly for 6 weeks to build the vehicle from scratch using simple tools. The students had to innovate and improvise along the way as they put together the different electrical components and mechanical parts of the vehicle. They had to overcome many challenges, such as the lack of advanced tools, faulty wheel alignment and a burnt circuit board. At the end, their resilience and perseverance paid off and they managed to complete a fully functioning electric vehicle. The vehicle passed all the required safety checks at SUTD and it was cleared to participate in the EV competitive races on 11 and 12 May at Heartbeat@Bedok. Even though the team vehicle did not emerge as one of the top teams in the race, it completed all the rounds with respectable timings comparable to polytechnics and other more experienced schools. Given that this was the first time the college participated in this competition, it was a commendable achievement and effort on the part of the students. Most importantly, the students gained&nbsp;new knowledge and hands-on skills in building the vehicle. It was a rare and enriching experience for all of them.</p>

<h3><strong>Engineering Innovation Challenge 2020</strong></h3>
<p>
The Engineering Innovation Challenge 2020 was organised by Science Centre Singapore and the Institute of Engineers, Singapore. In the challenge, JPJC students came up with novel ideas to improve food security in Singapore through the use of ionising radiation. They were also tasked to conduct research on how background radiation may vary with environmental conditions in Singapore. After months of hard work, four groups of students from JPJC were awarded the Merit Award in the category for junior college students.</p>

<h3><strong>**NUS Electrical and Computer Engineering Principles and Practice**</strong></h3>
<p>This module aimed to expose junior college students to computer and electrical engineering principles through a 6-week experiential learning programme. It focused on the engineering principles and practice of how computer-aided systems are designed and built. They were first taught the fundamental principles of electronic circuits through blended lessons, laboratory sessions and group discussions. They were then guided to apply these principles to build a sensor-assisted autonomous robotic vehicle. Upon completing the module, they could better appreciate the importance of circuits, signals, and sensors in system implementation.</p>
