Physics is a fundamental science which is concerned with understanding the natural world around us. A small number of basic principles and laws can be applied to explain and predict a wide range of physical events and phenomena. The fundamental theories of physics form the bedrock of modern technologies and are responsible for practical applications and advancement in many different fields of science and technology.</p>

<p>
Physics principles and models have been used to study weather patterns, earthquakes, and even movement of people and financial markets. Physics is the foundation for technology – from the basic light bulb to a cutting-edge quantum computer; from the simple can opener to a super-conducting high speed train.</p>

The subject equips students with skills of investigation, reasoning, analysis and evaluation, which are transferrable and useful to everyday life. It also develops attitudes and dispositions such as critical thinking and logical analysis, a curious and inquiring mind, and the ability to solve problems and grasp complex concepts. These important skills and attitudes are highly relevant in preparing students for higher education and future careers in physics-related or even non-science disciplines.</p>

<p>
In JC1, physics students will deepen their knowledge and understanding of classical Newtonian Physics and apply concepts of force, motion and energy to solve static and dynamic systems. In JC2, we will extend their learning to other branches of physics such as Waves, Electricity and Magnetism and Modern Physics.</p>
