Physics is a fundamental science which is concerned with understanding the natural world around us. A small number of basic principles and laws can be applied to explain and predict a wide range of physical events and phenomena. The fundamental theories of physics form the bedrock of modern technologies and are responsible for practical applications and advancement in many different fields of science and technology.</p>

<p>
Physics principles and models have been used to study weather patterns, earthquakes, and even movement of people and financial markets. Physics is the foundation for technology – from the basic light bulb to a cutting-edge quantum computer; from the simple can opener to a super-conducting high speed train.</p>

The subject equips students with skills in investigation, reasoning, analysis, and evaluation, which are widely transferable and valuable in daily life. It fosters critical thinking, curiosity, and logical problem-solving — qualities essential for understanding complex ideas. Students also learn to handle data analytics, using tools like Microsoft Excel to analyse large datasets, assess trends, and create insightful visualisations. These practical skills and attitudes are highly relevant in preparing students for higher education and careers in fields ranging from physics to data science, and beyond.</p>

<p>
In JC1, physics students will deepen their knowledge and understanding of classical Newtonian Physics and apply concepts of force, motion and energy to solve static and dynamic systems. In JC2, we will extend their learning to other branches of physics such as Waves, Electricity and Magnetism and Modern Physics.</p></div>
