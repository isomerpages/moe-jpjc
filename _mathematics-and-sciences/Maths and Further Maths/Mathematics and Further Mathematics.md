#### **Introduction**

	<p>
The purpose of learning mathematics at the A-level is two-fold. Firstly, it provides students, regardless of the intended course of study at the university, with a useful set of tools and problem solving skills to support their tertiary study. Secondly, learning mathematics expose students to a way of thinking that complements other ways of thinking developed through the other disciplines. This contributes to the development of a well-rounded individual who is able to think deeply, broadly and differently about problems and issues.

In Jurong Pioneer Junior College, the teachers in the Mathematics department are caring, engaging, and dedicated to sharing their knowledge of the subject and helping students to achieve personal excellence.
