<center><h5>MAKING THE JOURNEY WORTHWHILE</h5></center>

<p>
Cheng Wei Yang, Brandon is a young man with a big heart and a great sense of conviction about making a difference in the lives of others. In his two years at JPJC, Brandon was passionate about giving back to the community, particularly through supporting his peers with Special Educational Needs (SEN) and helping to raise awareness about mental health and wellness as a Peer Supporter. The calm and reassuring demeanour Brandon possesses belies his exceptional leadership potential and organisational skills. As President of the Guitar Ensemble, Brandon was instrumental in helping to improve the overall performance and quality of the ensemble.</p>

Brandon’s maturity and fierce commitment to striving for excellence have their origins in his meandering journey of self-discovery and growth that began in secondary school. Even upon completion of his O Level examinations and enrolling in a polytechnic, Brandon struggled to find meaning in pursuing his studies. He later dropped out, and attempted the A Level course at a private educational institution, where he found little guidance, and the pace of learning to be too brisk. When he finally joined Jurong Pioneer Junior College, he had only one shot at making it good at the A Level examinations. In a heartfelt reflection about his journey, Brandon admits that “It was really tough taking that long road. After all those detours, I saw junior college as a lifesaver for my terrible performance in the poly, and I don’t regret coming to JPJC. I really wanted to make good this time.”</p>

Brandon intends to pursue environmental engineering in the university – a decision fuelled by exposure to the field by both General Paper and Project Work lessons during his time in JPJC, and his passion for bettering the lives and world of those around him.</p></div>
