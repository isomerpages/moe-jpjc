<p>
With his tenacity and unwavering optimism, Muhammad Ijtihad B Muhammad A is an inspiration to his peers. When his mother’s long-standing health condition (brain cancer) took a turn for the worse during his 2020 A Level examinations, Ijtihad had to cope with the anguish of possibly losing a loved one and caring for her in her last days, while trying his best to focus on his papers at the same time. He also had to step in and provide emotional support for his three young siblings during such trying times, whenever their father was more heavily occupied with caring for their ill mother.</p>

Apart from being the eldest in the family and being mature beyond his years, Ijtihad had another side to him. He demonstrated a fierce dedication to, and great passion for football, which he committed to as a central pillar of his life. Owing to his exceptional talent, apart from being the Vice-Captain of the JPJC Football Team, Ijtihad was also selected to represent Singapore at the 47th Asian Schools Football Federation (ASFF) U-18 Championship in 2019. His optimism and resilience was also clearly demonstrated in his cheerful demeanour and pro-active approach to life and his studies – he never once complained about the strain and burden of having to juggle both his family challenges and his studies to his peers and teachers. Grateful for the opportunities and support given to him, Ijtihad also committed himself to giving back to society as a regular volunteer under Sports Singapore’s SportCares initiative, where he coached at-risk youths in both football and life skills.</p>

When asked to share about the things he treasured the most during his two years in JPJC, Ijtihad recalls fondly his teachers. “I would say that the teachers here really care about our welfare despite their really busy schedules. They take time to have consultations with you, but beyond that, they even give us good advice and emotional support.” Ijtihad had a succinct nugget of wisdom to share with his juniors. “Treasure all the good friends, teachers and great canteen food you will find here in JPJC”, he laughed as he fondly remembered the good old times he spent in the college.</p></div>
