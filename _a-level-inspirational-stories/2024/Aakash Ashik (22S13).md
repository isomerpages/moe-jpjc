<b>Mastering the Chessboard of Life – Every Move a Triumph in the Gambit</b>

“Storms make trees take deeper roots," reflected Aakash Ashik, and this unshaking belief set the stage for his tenacity in overcoming tough challenges that confronted him the last several years as he made his transition from adolescence to adulthood. Aakash faced the biggest personal storm in his young life — a sudden loss, grief, and the Herculean task of preparing for the A-Levels amidst emotional turmoil. His enthralling journey, spanning from Secondary 3 to the completion of A-Levels, unfolds against a backdrop of resilience. 

Born in India, Aakash came to Singapore when he was two months old with his mother because his father had been working in Singapore since 2000. When Aakash was in Secondary 3, his father was diagnosed with scleroderma, an autoimmune disease. Given that he was the elder child, the heavy burden of supporting his parents with caregiving as well as family chores fell on his shoulders. Juggling schoolwork with caring for his ailing father during regular hospital check-ups, assisting his mother with grocery shopping, and looking after his younger brother, Aakash had to painstakingly managed his time properly to balance school and family responsibilities. He believed that planning ahead would help him surmount the mountain of tasks. What kept him going was the importance of quality time with the family. Even in trying times, small happiness made big differences. “I used to be very excited for weekends because those two days were when my father would spend a lot of time playing with me, watching movies, and going out together with my mother and brother.”

Talking about his source of strength, Aakash shared, "Whenever I felt down, my father would come to my room, close the door, and talk to me. He would ask what the problem was and try to provide some examples that would encourage me in whatever situation I was in. Making my father proud was my main motivation.” The father-son bond was indeed very strong, forming one of the deep roots that anchored Aakash in his life pursuits. 

Things took a turn in 2023 when Aakash was in JC2. His father had to go back to India to get treatments during the June holidays. He recounted, “In the first few days, I had no motivation to revise for my Mid-year Examination because I felt a piece of me was missing. It was the first time my father was not with me for an extended period. My father called me from India and told me not to worry about him but to focus on getting good grades for the exams, which would make him happy.” Aakash found motivation in his father's words, pushing him to excel even during his father's absence. His determination yielded success in the JC2 Mid-year Examinations, a testament to his ability to persevere through adversity.

Shortly after that, tragedy struck during the Preliminary Examination, as the family received news of his father's sudden passing, leaving Aakash feeling completely lost and uncertain about everything. He was adrift. Despite the support from his family, Aakash struggled significantly with a profound loss of confidence and motivation, uncertain about his ability to successfully complete the A-Levels.

As Aakash grappled with his grief, poignant memories surfaced of him playing chess with his father, reminiscent of the times when he was just ten years old. His father, a mentor in the game, imparted valuable lessons on various openings, strategies for the middle phase, and endgame tactics. These lessons not only enhanced Aakash's strategic thinking in chess but also contributed to his overall improvement as a player. Now, with the weight of grief on his shoulders, Aakash found solace and guidance in the echoes of his father's teachings, hoping to draw strength from the strategies learned on the chessboard to navigate through the complexities of life and academics. 

Given his interest, Aakash was a member of the Chess Club and the game formed yet another root that kept him straight and strong. “It's not just a game; it's a mindset," Aakash insightfully remarked. "Chess teaches you to think ahead, plan your moves, and be prepared for the unexpected. These principles apply not only to the game but also to life." Aakash's chess journey at JPJC showcased not only his prowess on the board but also his ability to learn from defeats. The impactful lessons from playing chess played an important role in helping him tide over obstacles. 

Despite the challenges at home, Aakash still put in his utmost to lead a fulfilling college life with an active involvement in co-curricular activities. In the thrilling chapters of Aakash's chess journey, he proudly donned the college colours at the 14th Hwa Chong Cup in 2022. Amidst the intense clashes, he didn't just play the game; he engaged in post-game analysis with opponents. He shared, “I took great satisfaction in those victories; however, I gleaned even more from the losses. My opponents graciously shared insights into my missed opportunities and suggested alternative moves that could have placed me in a better position. This exchange not only broadened my understanding but also enabled me to acquire new tactics, ultimately enhancing my performance in future games.” This lively exchange of ideas became a treasure trove, enabling him to transform losses into opportunities for growth and enriching his strategic repertoire.

The saga continued in the JPJC Chess Tournament of 2023, a battleground that showcased Aakash's resilience. Despite facing a formidable setback in the initial game, he did not succumb to discouragement. Instead, he redirected his focus, adhering to fundamental strategies in subsequent matches. That strategic shift bore fruit, securing him three victories and two draws out of seven games. Those competitive escapades became pivotal chapters in Aakash's growth story, imprinting upon him the significance of perseverance in the face of challenges. Each move on the chessboard was a testament to his determination, motivating him to consistently push his abilities to new heights.

It was apparent that his dedication to the Chess Club was not merely a recreational pursuit but a training ground for the complexities he would face on the larger chessboard of life. Despite the hardships, Aakash never mentioned his family situation in school until the Preliminary Examination, revealing a level of stoicism that few could comprehend. 

Ms Chong Woon Hui, his Civics Tutor, deeply moved by his plight, shared, "He has been coping and doing well in school all along. I informed the class, and they rallied to support him. I created a Google folder for him, ensuring all information and documents were easily accessible.” Aakash was immensely grateful to Ms Chong Woon Hui and all his subject tutors, “When we reached India, we found out that my father had passed away. For a week, I felt that a part of me was now gone, and I felt like not doing anything. Ms. Chong understood that I would not return soon due to prayers that I needed to do. Hence, she helped to set up a Google Drive with all my subject tutors in it so that they can post all the work, Zoom links, and other information in that Google Drive. This helped me to reduce the stress of asking every single tutor for information and made me less worried about falling behind.”

Facing extended time in India for rituals and administrative matters, Aakash ensured he wouldn't miss school lessons by requesting Zoom sessions, diligently attending despite the 2.5-hour time difference such as waking up at 5.30 am India time to get ready to attend 8.30 am lessons in Singapore. Returning to Singapore just in time for his A-Level Science Practical Examinations and written papers, Aakash persevered through adversity to complete his A levels.

Aakash’s Chemistry tutor, Ms. Zhang Xiu Chen, commended, "He didn't finish some prelim papers and had to return to India for some time. When he was in India, I thought that he might need some time away from his studies to grieve, but he continued to show even more determination. He requested his marked prelim papers to be sent over to him and attended Zoom lessons diligently. Since he missed Chemistry Paper 1, he also requested me to send over the question paper so that he could try it on his own. Beyond Zoom lessons, he continued to clarify doubts on WhatsApp. The level of resilience and determination that he had demonstrated in the face of adversity is highly admirable.”

Aakash’s journey was marked by trials and tribulations preceding great responsibilities. His early experiences were akin to navigating a chessboard, with setbacks resembling opponents' moves. Aakash strategically orchestrated his moves, strategised his own version of 'checkmate,' and used adversities as stepping stones. In a poignant reflection, Aakash shared, "The trip back to India was rushed, and I may not have had all my revision materials with me. It added to the difficulty, but I told myself to stay resilient and try my best no matter what.”

His Civics Tutor, Ms Chong, provided insights into Aakash's tenacity, stating, "Aakash is really a great thinker. He's clear about his goals, able to take setbacks, extremely resilient, responsible, grateful, and mature."

Reflecting on his academic journey, Aakash shared, "The most challenging subject for me was Economics as it was very new to me.” He struggled to comprehend the concepts taught in class, and his attempts to review them at home proved unsuccessful. As a result, he barely passed his Economics checkpoint tests in JC1 semester one. During the JC1 June holidays, he identified his lack of effort in revising for Economics compared to his other subjects. Determined to improve, he dedicated more time to reading the content and creating thorough notes for himself. The shift in approach led to a better understanding of the material and noticeable improvements in his subsequent exams. 

Struggling with incomplete exam papers since JC1, he recognised the impact on his results. His parents encouraged and reminded him not to give up and focused on improving time management and content understanding. His father used to tell him, “You will never achieve the desired results if you do not put in full effort and consistently learn from the mistakes you have made in the past.” He took heed and diligently wrote notes for each subject, reviewed daily taught content promptly, and ensured the timely completion of assignments. To address his time management challenges, he developed a timetable, diligently followed it, and practiced other JC papers, progressively overcoming the issue, and achieving the ability to finish entire papers. The method and resolve that he honed from playing chess as well as the firm roots nurtured by his strongly supportive family enabled him to make remarkable progress over his time in JC. 

When asked what advice he would give to his juniors, he said, "Choose the right subject combination first, and then ensure you organise all your work, complete all the assignments properly, and hand them in on time. Never give up, even if you keep doing poorly in your exams because, with the right amount of effort and perseverance, you will eventually do well. Also, spend quality time with your friends because two years are very short, and it will go by quickly, so make the most of it."

Aakash always cherishes the time spent with his loved ones, that extended beyond his family and relatives to his CCA mates, and classmates. He expressed gratitude, saying, “I would like to thank my classmates for helping me collect and organise my papers when I was in India and cheering me up during trying times. Before A-Level, some of us had to attend extra lessons in the mornings during the study break. After these lessons, a few friends and I would stay back in school to revise and work on past year papers together. This not only allowed me to spend quality time with my friends, creating lasting memories, but also helped me prepare for A-Levels more efficiently.”

Aakash’s quest for knowledge extended beyond the classroom — a gambit of continuous learning and growth that expanded the board of his intellectual pursuits. His keen interest in Mathematics also led him to participate in the Australian Mathematics Competition in 2023 where he stretched himself intellectually beyond the scope of the H2 Mathematics syllabus. Furthermore, in 2023, Aakash eagerly enrolled in a Physics Webinar Learning Series titled "Deep Dive into Damped Driven Oscillations." This webinar allowed him to delve into a specific topic in physics, filling in any knowledge gaps and acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Through these participations, Aakash actively sought to expand his knowledge and remained engaged in continuous personal growth. 

Influenced by his father, who used to work as an equipment engineer, Aakash's passion lies in science subjects, particularly in the fields of Data Science, AI, Computer Science, and Information Technology. He envisions pursuing further studies in these areas, recognising them as the future trends that will shape the world. Aakash aspires to become a pillar of strength for his family while also contributing to the nation by leveraging his expertise in technology and science. His ambition reflects a commitment to personal growth and a desire to make a meaningful impact on both his immediate surroundings and the broader community. He is currently working as a part-time student care teacher while concurrently pursuing a programming course. 

In the grand chess game of life, Aakash Ashik is not merely a player, he emerges as the undisputed winner. Every move, be it in academics, chess, or personal development, is a calculated gambit leading him to victory. Aakash stands as the reigning champion of the game he masterfully played at Jurong Pioneer JC.

His life philosophy, "Work hard in silence; let success make the noise," echoes as a timeless reminder that success is not always measured by loud proclamations but by the strategic moves made in the pursuit of goals.

Ultimately, Aakash's triumph transcends the chessboard, reaching beyond academics to embody a holistic approach to life. He becomes an inspiration—a strategic player whose every move achieves triumphs echoing far beyond Jurong Pioneer Junior College.
