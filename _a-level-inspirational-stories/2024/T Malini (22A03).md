<figcaption>Meet T Malini_ The epitome of versatility and courage. From excelling in Triple Science to embracing the arts in JC, her unconventional pathway reflects her fearless pursuit of passion and purpose</figcaption></figure>

<b>From Triple Science to Arts, Malini blossomed and found her voice in JC</b>

<p>A triple science student in secondary school, T Malini was often described as a reserved student who should learn to speak up more. “My peers in secondary school were very competitive and also very vocal. Somehow it affected my self-esteem. I was rather timid and definitely not very confident to share my views as I was afraid I might say something wrong or that they might judge me,” Malini shared. </p>

<p>When Malini received her O-Level results, her confidence spiralled even further to an all-time low as her results were not as she had expected. </p>

<p>“I was quite disappointed with my O-Levels results and coming into Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC), I believe that my self-confidence was at the lowest point. It was very tough in the beginning to pick myself up and reassure myself that I still had the chance to turn things around for myself. I had to push myself and be open-minded to try new experiences. I am grateful that I was able to get past that phase as it allowed me to have a very fruitful JC experience,” Malini recalled.</p>

<p>In JPJC, she thought carefully about her options and made the courageous jump from the Triple Science to the Arts stream to pursue her interest in Literature. </p>

<p>“I have always loved Literature as it teaches us about the world and unique traits of individuals. However, I took triple science in secondary school thinking that it would give me the best options and pathways to choose later on. The normal perception in Singapore is also that the Sciences are more important so I went with this mainstream perception not knowing which subject I was passionate about.  But I realised after the O-levels that my Sciences weren’t my strength, so I decided to pursue my passion in the Arts,” Malini shared. </p>

<p>Taking Literature in JC was a turning point for Malini. As she had to share her views in Literature lessons, Malini started to grow more confident sharing thoughts and opinions on issues. Each lesson felt like she was transported into a different world. Her Literature teacher in school, Mdm Shamala, was also one of the reasons she grew more confident and loved the subject. “Mdm Shamala was very passionate about the subject and very supportive of us asking questions. During consults, she recognised little efforts that I have made and that slowly helped me to build confidence not only in answering Literature questions but also in asking more questions,” Malini recalled fondly of her teacher.</p>

<p>With her growing confidence, Malini decided go beyond her comfort zone by participating in a writing competition, Write and Burn! 2022, a prestigious poetry festival for youth literature enthusiasts. Inspired by her favourite Literature book, ‘Saint Joan’ by George Bernard Shaw, whose main character, Joan of Arc, was passionate about her cause and was an embodiment of feminine strength, Malini crafted a powerful poem about the evolving face of feminism and its impact on society. 
Her thoughtful and impactful poem encouraged meaningful dialogue around feminism, emphasising the importance of amplifying diverse voices and staying open-minded and empathetic. Malini managed to rise above her own personal struggles with self-confidence and showcased her ability to use words as a catalyst for change to raise awareness about crucial societal issues.</p>

<p>Malini’s involvement as a student leader in the Student Council (SC) was also one of the impetus for her transformation from a reserved student to an eloquent, confident speaker. While she was a student leader in her Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), Band, in secondary school, she was mostly tasked with the administrative aspects of the CCA and accounting for the instruments, which provided less opportunity for her to develop fuller leadership skills such as relationship-building.</p>

<p>However, in JC, as the Welfare Executive in SC, she was tasked with various responsibilities including organising events such as the college’s Welfare Bazaars, Matriculation and Orientation and Graduation Night which required her to liaise and negotiate effectively with others including external vendors. The experiences not only honed her leadership and communication abilities but also highlighted her resourcefulness and adaptability. </p>

<p>The ample opportunities she was given in JC also enabled her to hone her public speaking skills. As a student presenter at the Jurong Pioneer-Yishun Innova Leadership Conference, she shared her experiences on event management with fellow student leaders. Malini also showcased her oratorical skills when she served as an emcee for Teachers' Day Celebrations. </p>

<p>With the experiences garnered in public speaking, Malini went on further to take an even greater step to participate in a national event, the Pre-University Seminar 2023. As a panel discussion moderator, she skilfully navigated discussions with a diverse group of experts in the field and enthusiastically engaged the audience, honing her public speaking, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills.</p> 

<p>“I was actually quite nervous because it was a national event. But my form teacher, Ms Vani, reassured me. I was heartened as even teachers who did not teach me came up to me just before the event to give some words of encouragement and support,” said Malini.</p>

<p>Beyond her participation in college activities, Malini also used her newfound confidence to serve the community. She sourced her own Values in Action (VIA) projects and participated in a Sustainability Festival ‘YouthWave EcoFest’ where she had to teach children to be more sustainable in their daily habits by creating home products using recyclable and biodegradable materials. Malini strongly believes that young people should serve their community. She went on to participate in other VIAs including event management in the countdown at Keat Hong. Her continued passion in serving the community can be seen in her own personal goal which is to help the migrant workers in the community in 2024 through serving at Krsna’s Free Meals, a food kitchen in Singapore run by volunteers providing breakfast and lunch for migrant workers in Singapore.</p>

<p>An only child, Malini is grateful to her parents for teaching her to give her 100% in all that she does and to develop herself holistically in JC. As she does not have many relatives who have gone to university, she hopes her efforts and opportunities seized in JC will enable her to get to her university faculty of choice to make her parents proud. </p>

<p>“My family and friends say that I am a totally different person after entering JC. I used to be afraid to share my views and thoughts, but my JC experience was a transformative one. I have definitely experienced my highest of highs in JC with a very nurturing and supportive environment. JPJC provided me with the opportunities to push myself beyond my comfort zone, allowing me to explore new experiences and confront my fears. Taking on leadership roles, I have developed the mental tenacity to navigate challenges in this journey. This has boosted my self-confidence. JC has also provided me with a very strong support system where I know that I can always fall back on my friends and teachers for guidance and advice,” reflected Malini. </p>

<p>Ms Tamil Vani, her form teacher, also saw the change in Malini, “Malini blossomed to become more vivacious and outgoing and was the heartbeat of the class. I am impressed by her level of commitment towards the things that she is most passionate about.”</p>

<p>With her newfound confidence, Malini hopes to pursue Political Science, Law or Public Policy Studies in university.</p>
