<b>A Polytechnic Withdrawal Form that became the Winning Ticket to being the Top Arts Student</b>

<p>Enzo Koh's odyssey from a polytechnic dropout to the Top Arts student at Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) is a testament to the transformative power of resilience, family support, and a deep-seated passion for mathematics and economics. His narrative, marked by introspective moments and unwavering determination, weaves a compelling tale of self-discovery.</p>

<p>Once a solid foundation that provided a strong footing for Enzo’s future, his successful application in the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) for an accountancy spot at Ngee Ann Polytechnic had become a stumbling block, casting a cloud of uncertainty in his education journey. At the time, he was contented with the tangible polytechnic option in hand as it had aligned with his love for Mathematics and its prestige with promises of a high salary. Having secured his admission post O Levels, Enzo had never taken the time to consider, what more research the JC option. In fact, he was pleasantly surprised when it surfaced as a possibility on the very day of the O Level results release. "I remember seeing that I qualified for JC, and a small moment of hesitation came fleeting by, but I pushed this nagging feeling aside. I already had a surefire polytechnic option that had presented as a logical path," he shared, his tone conveying a mix of contentment and conviction in his chosen direction. Little did he know, this seemingly casual dismissal would soon shape his academic journey in ways he never anticipated.</p>

<p>As Enzo navigated the uncharted waters of polytechnic life, he found himself at odds with the content of his course. "Accountancy felt more business-like than I expected, less mathematical, and the thought of studying it for three years was daunting," he confessed to the thoughts that had stirred up a dread in him. The polytechnic landscape characterised by its highly flexible nature which Enzo had initially deemed as a plus point, was further reinforced by the faceless pandemic as it had evolved to a labyrinth of virtual interactions that lacked the coordinated and structured curricular environments – a familiarity which Enzo craved. Feeling lost and adrift in the sea of multiple options without a sense of belonging, he yearned for a stable anchor. The cognizant young man even acknowledged, “I am well aware that poly could be a better reflection of uni life in terms of its more open and varied form, but I was clear that I needed to get through this transition successfully to make it to uni in the first place.” </p>

<p>After all, for as long as he could remember, a university education had been his dream as a little boy – to be the first person in his family to accomplish that was a huge deal. It was a goal that he held close to his heart, fuelled not only by personal ambitions but also by a deep-rooted sense of gratitude and responsibility. Hailing from a humble background, Enzo saw how hard his parents, a driver and sales personnel, toiled at work, to give him the life he had even as they had little for themselves. “It broke my heart to see how much sacrifices they had made and I want to repay them by providing them with good lives in the future.” </p>

<p>With doubts of poly life swivelling in his mind, Enzo sought advice from his secondary school friend, who had gone on to JPJC post O levels. In his research, he found comfort in the testimonials of a warm school culture and caring educators – glowing reviews that shaped the pivotal moment where his curiosity would lead him down a different path. Furthermore, Enzo was enthralled by the range of subjects that he would be able to read. It was a refreshing change from specialisation as he had harboured a passion for a variety of them – from the humanities subjects of History and Economics to his perennial favourite, Mathematics. He was not done with them in secondary school and being able to study contrasting subjects suited his nature very well indeed. With that, Enzo decided to take the plunge, only after a mere few months at the polytechnic.</p>

<p>“Of course, I was scared! But I didn’t want to be wavered by fear on something I knew had to be done.” exclaimed Enzo as he recalled that defining point of no return when he dropped the withdrawal form off with his mum, with his dad still kept in the dark. Enzo understood that his father’s worries were not unfounded. After all, the notion of forsaking a polytechnic education, a route traditionally deemed mainstream, ventured into uncharted territory. While conventional wisdom often witnessed overwhelmed JC students opting for polytechnic courses, the reverse was a narrative less heard of, adding an extra layer of concern. Yearning for his father’s support, Enzo gathered his family for a crucial meeting where he shared his thinking and addressed concerns via a mind-map that he had made which articulated the pros-and-cons of his decision. The clarity of his thoughts illuminated how right this decision was. “Honestly, there was never going to be a perfect solution. JC or Poly – there’s no definitive right or wrong of what a ‘successful’ pathway would be. I can only do my best at that moment, to weigh both sides and determine for myself what suits me best. My parents could also see how unhappy I had been the past few months. When all is said and done, they simply want me to be happy. With that, they never doubted me and supported my decision wholeheartedly.” Indeed, gratitude towards his parents emerges as a recurring theme in Enzo's narrative. Not wanting to fail their trust, Enzo busied himself with studying the JC curriculum even before the term officially began. </p><p>

</p><p>The halls of Jurong Pioneer Junior College came alive for Enzo from the very first day he stepped foot into the college. “Orientation was a blast and I found myself very comfortable with the atmosphere from the get-go. It made the transition much smoother than I thought it would be.” Enzo also felt instantly at home with the cozy environment. He grinned as he reminisced the precious memories of the past 2 years especially in the times where the whole college came together to celebrate festivities, complete with fun booths, social activities and energetic assemblies. “It’s a magic combination of 3 – teachers, friends and the JP experience. You could feel the vibrant energy. It was a warm feeling to have the whole college – friends and teachers – come together to have fun even as we both worked hard for our academics. Work hard, play hard, right?” It was also with this conviction that Enzo volunteered as an Orientation Group Leader. Having trodden this path of nerves, he wanted to play his part to welcome the new incoming students.</p>

<p>Indeed, Enzo thrived. In the JC1 Promotional Examination, he topped the cohort for 2 subjects – Economics and History – and was crowned the Top Arts Student. He also found new passions as his love for numbers, coupled with an emerging fascination for economics, propelled him to offer the formidable H3 Economics for the A Levels, with a focus on Game Theory, an academic challenge that would reshape his intellectual landscape. “It was the most challenging and hardest subject I ever encountered. I even felt a bit of an imposter sitting with other students from the top schools having discussions with them. But the excitement of the subject kept me going. I relished the opportunity, I wanted to see where I could go with it.” </p>

<p>The academic terrain at JPJC was diverse and challenging, with Enzo not only excelling in his studies but also immersing himself in debates –  a new skill he had long wanted to pick up due to his interest in current affairs but never had the chance to. He recalled proudly how his team emerged as Grand Champions against tough opponents – a bonus rather than a focus. "It was nerve-wracking, but we pulled through. That experience taught me the power of teamwork and perseverance," Enzo reflected. As the Vice-President of the team, Enzo also felt moved by their camaraderie. They were one in their quest to becoming better debaters and he witnessed how they pushed and helped one another. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, the academic rigour of the new JC2 year got to Enzo. The A Levels were looming near and each major examination seem to happen in quick succession. The accolades of yesteryear had unintentionally set a standard that was self-imposed, creating a silent pressure that compounded his anxiety when he found himself struggling to meet the bar. Despite the outward perception that he excelled effortlessly, Enzo battled his own academic hurdles. "I was now seen as someone who would do well with nothing to stress about, but that could not be further from the truth. I was no genius; I had to put in lots of effort too," he confessed, breaking the illusion of ease that surrounded him. He sought solace in photography as he found ways to immortalise the beautiful moments all around. This creative outlet had become a sanctuary, offering respite from the academic storm and reaffirming his belief of a holistic approach to life. In these moments of self-doubt, what anchored him were the words of close friends and his parents. It reminded him of his resolve right at the start of his JC journey – not the first day of school but the day he withdrew. It was that very same lesson again – the sentiment that there was no right or wrong in success; he simply had to try his best. His mother, in particular, discouraged the idea of putting unnecessary pressure on himself, assuring him that life held alternative paths even if traditional academic success proved elusive. Enzo had come full circle. </p>

<p>When asked what his ambitions were for the future, Enzo brimmed with enthusiasm. “Teaching! It is not just a career for me; it's a calling." Interestingly, Enzo had turned down opportunities to apply for more prestigious and attractive scholarships in other areas, choosing teaching instead, with pay and prestige no longer serving as motivations. His ambition to become a math teacher stems from the joy he finds in unravelling the complexities of the subject and the desire to share this enthusiasm with others, a passion he stumbled on when guiding his classmates on their mathematics homework. The spark for this ambition was ignited under the guidance of his mathematics tutor, Mr. Kum Mun Fai. Enzo spoke highly of Mr. Kum, expressing gratitude for the unwavering support he received. "Whenever we were unsure of something, he would readily assist us, even outside of school hours." His teaching style also left a lasting impression on Enzo who recounted, "He always does his best, even if it means showing tough love. Teaching H2 math to arts students is challenging but Mr Kum is persistent. He does not feed us with answers but encourages us to think through the process—a teaching approach that aligns perfectly with my idea of what a teacher should be." Beyond technicalities of mathematical principles, Enzo had also sought for career guidance from Mr Kum, finding inspiration in his dedication. "I know that being a teacher would not be a bed of roses. But it is a passion that I want to carry forward, just as Mr. Kum has done for me.” Enzo also paid tribute to his civics tutors – mentors who provided not just academic guidance but emotional support during challenging times. "Having teachers who believe in you makes a world of difference. They saw my potential even when I doubted it." </p>

<p>As Enzo looks ahead to university life and a future in teaching, his story serves as a nuanced narrative of triumph over adversity. "No matter where you start, it's about the journey you undertake. Make it count!”</p>
