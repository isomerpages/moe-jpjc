<b>Illuminated Paths: An inspirational journey guided by mentors</b>

<p>“Jurong Pioneer JC became more than just an educational institution for me; it became a canvas for my talents to flourish," reflected Tay Li Yang, speaking with gratitude about the school that became the nurturing ground for his multifaceted abilities. Coming from a close-knitted secondary school, Li Yang felt it was instrumental to pursue his education in a similar environment. “Thankfully, JPJC provides such a great opportunity for me to study comfortably with friends and teachers, as well as an excellent quality of education that allows me to thrive in my academics.”</p>

<p>In the intricate world of education, where potential abounds like the proverbial horse, capable of a-thousand-mile journey each day (千里马), true visionary mentors (伯乐) are gems. At Jurong Pioneer Junior College, this adage finds resonance in the extraordinary journey of Tay Li Yang, a standout individual whose exceptional talents across diverse fields unveil the school's nurturance and their provision of opportunities.</p>

<p>Li Yang’s parents had been working in Singapore even before he was born. After finishing his primary education in Malaysia, they decided to bring him in pursuit of better educational opportunities and learning experiences. At home, Mandarin is the language his family mostly use and which he feels most connected with. Under his parents’ influence, he had been exposed to many Chinese dramas, musical shows, movies, and other Chinese comics and books from a young age. They would take him to several Chinese mandopop concerts and the likes of Andy Lau and Jacky Cheung, deepened his passion for Chinese music and sparked a keen interest in learning more about its culture. He added, “I believe that the passion and love I have for Chinese culture are what kept me going, wanting to explore different parts and areas of Chinese culture and identities.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, Li Yang did not exercise his option for the Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) during the Joint Admission Exercise (JAE) despite this being the main admissions route for CLEP students. The risk was a calculated move, “I wanted to have a firsthand understanding of CLEP to learn more about the program and make an informed decision.” After hearing many positive reviews, he decided to give it a try. Proactively, Li Yang sought out the teacher in-charge to express his profound interest and passion. While intrigued by his interest, Mrs. Tan-Lim Soh Whee had spotted the fact that Li Yang holding PR status which meant that he would not be eligible to be considered for the MOE CLEP scholarship. Nonetheless, this did not deter him from joining and he pledged to give his best if accepted. Touched by his enthusiasm, the teachers decided to offer him a place in the 17th cohort of the college’s niche Chinese Language Elective Programme.</p>

<p>Li Yang was then afforded a wealth of opportunities for exposure and enrichment. He participated not only in events such as the CLEP Lecture Series and the H2 Chinese Language Seminar organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE) but also in college-based cultural immersion workshops, including Drumming, Tea Appreciation, and Mandarin Lyrics Writing and Songwriting. </p>

<p>In a further demonstration of his appreciation for the Chinese language, literature, and culture, he participated in several 'Xin Kong Xia' Xinyao Music appreciation sessions co-organised by the college and the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL) in 2022. His deep appreciation for this unique genre of music from Singapore showcased his love for local culture. Li Yang took a leap of faith and composed ‘Building Dreams’ (筑梦) alongside three other like-minded friends. Their piece emerged as the 1st runner-up in the 2022 'Xin Kong Xia' National Singing and Songwriting Competition. Li Yang explained the meaning behind it, “The song was initially titled ‘Excuses’ (借口) to encourage everyone to stop finding excuses and start taking actions to chase their dreams. After discussions with our instructor, we changed it to ‘Building Dreams’ as it was more meaningful. In the process of chasing dreams, facing failures and finding excuses is inevitable. However, by taking gradual actions and building the pieces of our dreams, we can eventually meet our goals. The lyrics reflect life's ups and downs, emphasising the importance of holding onto the fire and desire for our dreams, overcoming obstacles, and making dreams come true.”</p>

<p>"Jurong Pioneer JC saw more in me than I saw in myself. The teachers believed in my potential and encouraged me to explore every facet of my abilities," Li Yang shared, emphasising the pivotal role mentors played in shaping his journey. The teachers appointed him as a camp group leader in the MOE-CLEP Camp 2022, a role he was not expecting. He demonstrated excellent leadership skills by facilitating activities and discussions among CLEP students from various junior colleges.</p>

<p>His continuous good performance, positive thinking and charisma caught the teachers’ eyes. Li Yang was nominated by his CLEP teachers and the Head of the Department (HOD) for Mother Tongue Languages, Mrs. Chionh-Lim Sheau Jen, to apply for the Pei Hwa Scholarship. The scholarship interview marked a significant milestone in Li Yang's journey. Nervous though prepared, his diverse experiences and valuable portfolio made him stand out. Gratitude flowed not just for the scholarship but for the teachers and the head of the department who recognised his potential. "The scholarship interview was a defining moment. It wasn't just about monetary award; it was about validation. My teachers’ recognition fuelled my belief in my capabilities," Li Yang reflected, underscoring the impact of mentorship on his self-confidence.</p>

<p>Li Yang served as a zealous advocate for JPJC's CLEP, passionately imparting his experiences to secondary school students intrigued by the programme. He expressed, "Such sharing may seem insignificant, but it is, in fact, an invaluable opportunity for many of my juniors. It allows them to delve deeper into the realms of CLEP, offering ample knowledge and support should they harbour an interest in joining our vibrant JP CLEP family."</p>

<p>In the culminating chapter of his CLEP odyssey, he stood as the chosen representative for his cohort and delivered a speech during the joint CLEP &amp; MLEP graduation ceremony. “I truly believe that the culture and tradition of Chinese, whether in music, literature, or heritage, should be passed down to our future generations. This is essential for them to understand the history of Chinese culture and feel proud to be part of such a unique group with extraordinary customs and morals,” shared Li Yang in his speech.  </p>

<p>Embarking on his metaphorical journey as the proverbial horse (千里马), Li Yang became the embodiment of talent symbolised by this ancient saying. His story mirrors the school's ability to attract and nurture students with exceptional potential. Jurong Pioneer JC became a fertile ground where unique talents thrived, and individual journeys were celebrated. </p>

<p>The school's commitment went beyond textbooks; it extended into sculpting well-rounded individuals poised for success. Diving into Li Yang's exceptional talents revealed not only academic prowess but leadership roles across various fields. As the Vice-Captain of the Basketball Team, Li Yang exhibited remarkable abilities in cultivating a robust team spirit among his teammates and rallying them for shared goals. He served as an inspirational yet humble leader, garnering the respect of his peers. Li Yang represented the college in prestigious events such as the National School Games Basketball Championship 2022, Gryphons-Eagles FIRE Tourney 2023, and Raffles Basketball League 2022, showcasing both his commitment and sporting prowess. As a responsible Class Manager, Li Yang earned the trust of his tutors and classmates, demonstrating the ability to make sound decisions under pressure and handle stress effectively. His reliability, task management skills, and amicable personality made him an effective assistant to his tutors.</p>

<p>Li Yang's personal account sheds light on the challenges he faced and overcame. Reflecting on his academic journey, he shared, "The most challenging subject for me was General Paper (GP) due to a lack of basic vocabulary and foundation." Initially struggling, he embarked on an intense journey of hard work and expressed gratitude to his teacher, Ms. June Chng, for her unwavering guidance. He shared, "I’m truly thankful for my teachers for providing me with support and encouragement during tough times. Particularly, my GP teacher never gave up on me when I scored poorly in the JC1 Mid-year Examinations. She consistently provided me with practice papers weekly, taught me vocabulary and grammar regularly, which significantly improved my English. Li Yang shared a memorable achievement when he scored a ‘B’ for GP during the J2 Mid-year Examinations, a vast improvement from the ‘E’ grade just a year earlier. “The school invested in me, not just as a student, but as an individual with dreams and aspirations. That investment made all the difference in my journey. Teachers here don't just teach subjects; they shape futures. They saw my strengths and weaknesses and guided me to become the best version of myself,” Li Yang stated, acknowledging the school's role in shaping his trajectory.
Reflecting on challenges, Li Yang mentioned facing a significant setback when he fractured his ankle in the week prior to the A Levels, and had to undergo surgery. Despite the severity of the injury and the upcoming A-level examinations, he remained resilient. He emphasised the importance of staying flexible during unexpected events, grateful for the support of his parents and friends who cared for him, provided meals, arranged a wheelchair, and offered motivation during a challenging time. This incident inspired him to value adaptability, health, and safety during crucial periods. </p>
	
<p>Li Yang's personal quotes, "Rest in the end, not in the middle," and "First you learn, then remove the L," encapsulate his philosophy of continuous learning and resilience. These quotes offer a glimpse into his mindset, portraying a student who embraces challenges and sees them as opportunities for growth. "My motivation to excel in all areas is fuelled by my competitiveness and hunger to win, driving me to stay motivated throughout the process and ultimately achieving success.”</p>

<p>"The college also provided me with wonderful learning experiences and an environment where I can learn and study comfortably. I’m grateful for the night study programme during A-level preparation time, where I was able to revise and work until late night every day, with teachers on duty helping me on weaker subjects as well. Our school cleaners, canteen vendors, and the security guards also put in their work to ensure we have an enjoyable and conducive environment to study in." Indeed, Li Yang is always thankful. Once, he bought a cup of coffee for a cleaner uncle when he saw the uncle falling asleep sitting at the spiral staircases.</p>
	
<p>“Currently, I am dedicated to maintaining discipline in my daily routine, incorporating regular workouts, and prioritising my injury recovery to better prepare myself for National Service. Additionally, I am involved in part-time work to support my personal financial growth. Exploring different job opportunities provides me with insights into areas of interest for potential future endeavours. One aspiration I have is becoming a psychologist. I have a very strong interest in this work aspect, as I'm curious about how and why each of us thinks differently. I am keen to help people in their different situations, hoping they can feel better and more comfortable both emotionally and spiritually.”
In Li Yang’s story, the adage resounds – ‘though swift horses are common, good judges of talents are not (千里马常有, 而伯乐不常有)’. He stands as a testament to the supportive mentorship he found in Jurong Pioneer JC. As he seeks new horizons, the school's role as a visionary mentor(伯乐) becomes evident, highlighting the college's dedication to providing opportunities and nurturing generations of students coming through its gates.</p>
