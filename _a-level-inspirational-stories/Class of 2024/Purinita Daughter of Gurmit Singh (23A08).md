<b><h5>From Faraway Roots to a New Home  - A student’s love for the Malay language and culture, despite not coming from a Malay-speaking background.</h5></b>

<p>Purinita d/o Gurmit Singh’s journey in Jurong Pioneer Junior College’s Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) exemplifies her remarkable dedication to a language and culture that were not part of her upbringing. As the daughter of a Punjabi father and a Filipino mother, neither of whom spoke Malay, her decision to pursue H2 Malay Language and Literature (H2MLL) in Junior College was both bold and inspiring. Despite her parents requiring an English briefing during the MLEP talk, their unwavering support for her passion remained evident throughout her journey.</p>
 
<p>Having spent her early childhood in the Philippines, she faced the daunting task of assimilating into Singapore’s unique cultural milieu upon her arrival in Primary 3—an experience that left her both ambivalent and determined. “I was used to a different rhythm of life back in the Philippines. Transitioning here wasn’t easy, but it taught me early on that happiness doesn’t take much and that every culture has its own valuable lessons to offer,” she reflects. A pivotal moment came when she had to choose her Mother Tongue language, and she chose Malay over Chinese or Tamil—an option that, though challenging at first for a non-Malay student, became the gateway to a new identity. “I could have been exempted, but my parents believed in the opportunity to learn a language that was so integral to Singapore’s heritage.” The decision was far from easy. In her early years of learning Malay, she grappled with unfamiliar vocabulary and complex grammar structures, often feeling out of place among her peers. But with perseverance, she immersed herself in the language, taking every opportunity to practice and refine her skills. She actively sought out opportunities to use the language, engaged in cultural activities, and dedicated extra hours to mastering the subject to a point where she fell in love with the language and culture and decided to be part of the Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) in junior college. </p>

<p>Within the programme, her academic achievements set her apart. Selected for the MOE MLEP Scholarship, she excelled under the mentorship of her Malay teachers, Cikgu Atiqah and Cikgu Siti Khadijah. Exposure to a variety of literary sources and opportunities to refine her writing and speaking skills deepened her love for the language and culture. Her essays and analyses often surpassed the expectations for non-native speakers, reflecting a profound understanding of Malay literature. Furthermore, her involvement in the NUS Malay Studies Mentoring Programme allowed her to delve into the historical and linguistic roots of the Malay community, further enriching her perspective.</p>

<p>Her passion for Malay culture also extended far beyond academics. As the President of the Malay Cultural Society (MCS), she actively worked to promote the language and culture among her peers. Her leadership role in MCS opened up further avenues for creativity and community engagement. Purinita spearheaded the Dikir Barat performances at the JPJC Open House, an event that required rigorous planning and coordination among students from diverse backgrounds. “Working on the Dikir Barat performance was both challenging and exhilarating,” she says. “It wasn’t just about rehearsing lines or perfecting rhythms; it was about uniting students with different cultural backgrounds and demonstrating that our collective efforts can create something truly beautiful.” This project not only showcased her organisational skills but also deepened her understanding of cultural nuances- a skill that she believes will be invaluable in her future studies in Malay Studies at university. “It was eye-opening to see non-Malay peers join in and appreciate the richness of our language and traditions. Representing this facet of our college culture to the public was incredibly meaningful,” she shares, as her eyes light up at the memory of long practice sessions and the camaraderie that blossomed among her fellow students.</p>

<p>Beyond the classroom, Purinita’s life at JPJC had been a crucible for personal growth and cultural enrichment. One of her most memorable experiences was participating in Ms. Zaleena’s classes, where innovative teaching methods transformed complex subjects into interactive challenges. “Ms. Zaleena had us sitting in cubicles to simulate confinement during class debates and discussions,” Purinita recalls. “It wasn’t just about academic excellence—it was about pushing our boundaries and building character.” These unique learning experiences not only helped her excel in subjects like Malay Literature and Economics but also instilled a lifelong passion for critical thinking and cultural discourse. Purinita also dabbled in a whole host of diverse interests outside of college. Alongside managing her school work, she tried out auditioning for plays, writing more frequently, and at times even juggling part-time jobs to support her dream of entering the literary scene in Singapore. Each day is a balancing act between classes, creative pursuits, and personal responsibilities but every challenge only made her more determined to succeed.</p>

<p>Purinita’s academic journey has not been without personal hardships. With three older sisters and a busy family where her parents are often working, she learned early to stand on her own. During the crucial first week of A-levels, a series of family health challenges tested her resolve- her mother suffered a mild heart attack, later requiring surgery, while her father has battled chronic illness, even undergoing toe amputations due to diabetes. “Having to be there for my family, especially during my mother’s hospital stays, meant that I had to find a way to focus even when I wasn’t in my comfort zone,” she explains. “It taught me that with discipline and determination, I can overcome anything.” Throughout these trials, a network of teachers, friends, and mentors proved to be her greatest support. Teachers like Ms. Zaleena and Cikgu Atiqah pushed her academically and encouraged her to explore opportunities beyond the classroom- from taking part in writer mentorship programmes to participating in drama projects that honed her public speaking and performance skills. “They never let me feel that I was alone. Their guidance helped me see that every setback was a setup for a greater comeback,” Purinita asserts.</p>

<p>Purinita’s life is a tapestry of contrasts—between her early struggles with assimilation and her eventual embrace of the Malay language and culture, between personal hardships at home and the unwavering support from her teachers and peers at school. Through every setback, she found a lesson in resilience and adaptability. “There were days when I felt lost or overwhelmed, but every challenge pushed me to discover a strength I didn’t know I had,” she reflects. “I learned that adapting to a new environment isn’t about losing who you are; it’s about integrating new experiences into your identity.” </p>

<p>This philosophy has guided her not only academically but also in her creative pursuits. With a passion for writing and drama, Purinita has taken every opportunity to express herself- whether through crafting thoughtful essays, auditioning for local plays, or even volunteering for community theatre projects. Her journey in the arts has been a constant reminder that creativity and resilience often go hand in hand. “Every script I read or performance I take part in teaches me something new about myself and the world around me,” she says. “It’s a process of continuous learning, much like life itself.”</p>
	
<p>Looking ahead, Purinita is eager to further her passion for Malay studies at the National University of Singapore, with ambitions in translation, media, or any field that marries culture and language. “I see my future as a blend of academia and creative expression,” she says. “I want to use my love for language to build bridges between communities and share stories that matter.” Her dream is to contribute to a more inclusive society; one where cultural differences are celebrated rather than seen as obstacles. Her advice to juniors is both practical and heartfelt: “Never postpone your planning. Start early, understand your subjects deeply, and remember that every struggle you overcome is a step toward becoming a stronger, more well-rounded person.” Purinita believes that time management and the ability to seek support when needed are critical skills that will serve any student well, both in school and in life.</p></div>
