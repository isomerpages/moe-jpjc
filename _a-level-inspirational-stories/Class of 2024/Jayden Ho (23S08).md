<b><h5>Brave the Odds, Blaze the Trails: Jayden’s Story of Overcoming Challenges despite his Disability</h5></b>

<p>In a crowd of junior college students, Jayden Ho Yuxuan, a student from Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) often stood out. Born with Poland Syndrome- a congenital condition that led to visible physical abnormality on his hand, Jayden often received stares and questions about his condition. However, he always had a resolve not to let this condition define him or hinder his ambitions. Instead, he embraces challenges as opportunities for growth, channelling his determination into academics, leadership, and community service. For Jayden, stepping into JPJC carried more weight than it did for the average student as he saw yet another opportunity to further strengthen his resilience by overcoming a new set of challenges in this new environment.</p>

<p>Jayden’s decision to join JPJC was fueled by its warm and inclusive environment. From the moment he attended the college’s Open House, he felt a strong sense of belonging, thanks to the enthusiastic students who shared their experiences with passion. Having been under the leadership of Mr. Kevin Ang (the current Principal of JPJC) for four years at Bukit View Secondary School earlier, Jayden felt a sense of continuity and confidence in his choice. "JPJC felt like home the moment I stepped in. The students, teachers, and culture of inclusivity made me feel welcomed and empowered," he reflected.</p>

<p>Jayden’s passion for excellence is evident in his diverse range of commitments. Pursuing a subject combination of H2 Chemistry, H2 Mathematics, H2 Economics, and H1 Biology, he balanced a rigorous academic workload while serving as an Executive of the Welfare Committee in the Student Council. His leadership in the council saw him spearheading impactful initiatives, including the Racial Harmony Day Welfare Bazaar and the Leadership Workshop for Choa Chu Kang Secondary School. Beyond the college gates, Jayden dedicated his time to volunteering at his church and the Meet-The-People Sessions (MTPS), where he played a role in understanding and addressing the concerns of residents in his constituency.</p>

<p>"I’ve always believed that my disability is not something that holds me back—it’s what drives me forward. Whether it was performing academically, executing a successful event in Student Council or making a meaningful contribution to my community, that sense of fulfillment kept me going, even during the most stressful periods," Jayden shared.</p>
	
<p>Jayden took on H2 Chemistry, a subject known for its intensive practical component. Practical sessions were particularly challenging due to his physical constraints, as he was unable to conduct certain experiments on his own. However, with the support of his Chemistry tutor, Mdm Helena Tay, Jayden adapted.</p>&nbsp;
	
<p>"He was always receptive, hardworking, and optimistic. Even though he had the option to be exempted from the A-Level Chemistry Practical Examination, he chose to take it, demonstrating his resilience and determination," recalled Mdm Tay. Through consistent effort and meticulous planning, Jayden developed a strong understanding of lab procedures, practicing the mental routine of simulating experiments before executing them. Over time, his confidence grew, and he became more independent in the science lab.</p>

<p>For Jayden, resilience is rooted in a growth mindset. Throughout his journey, there were moments when he felt underestimated or faced misunderstandings. Yet, rather than being discouraged, he chose to prove his capabilities through actions. “Sometimes people aren’t open to conversations, and that’s okay. I let my work speak for itself,” he said. He also credits his mother’s advice for shaping his perspective: “We can’t always control our circumstances, but we can decide how we use them to motivate ourselves.”</p>

<p>Jayden attributes much of his resilience to Mr. Ang’s emphasis on grit and the power of adopting a growth mindset. “Mr. Ang always emphasised how adopting a growth mindset can mould someone to be optimistic even when circumstances appear tough. This has helped me see failures as temporary setbacks rather than roadblocks,” Jayden said. This perspective allowed him to face challenges head-on and constantly push himself to improve.</p>

<p>Jayden’s perspective on resilience was also profoundly shaped by a motivational talk given by Tracy Schmitt, also known as “Unstoppable Tracy.” Born without fully developed limbs, Tracy's message—“If you have no excuses, you have no limits”— resonated deeply with Jayden. Inspired by her words, he adopted a mindset where his disability was not a barrier but a source of strength, pushing him to exceed expectations.</p>
	
<p>His resilience and inclusivity were evident in his other subjects. Ms Yew Lee Yin, his H2 Mathematics tutor, described him as "positive, forthcoming, and resilient." He was highly participative during group discussions and presentations, ensuring that his classmates—including those with special needs—felt included and engaged. Mr. Toh Wei Ming, his H2 Economics tutor, added, "Regardless of whether his test results were good or bad, Jayden always maintained a positive attitude. He took care of his table mates, creating a supportive learning environment." Ms. Sandra Tian, his H1 Biology tutor, echoed similar sentiments, describing Jayden as “respectful, optimistic, and resilient.” She found him a joy to teach and noted that he was highly participative and took the initiative to clarify doubts.</p>

<p>Jayden’s leadership extended beyond the classroom. As an Executive Member of the Welfare Committee in the Student Council, he played a crucial role in organising college-wide events such as the Racial Harmony Day Welfare Bazaar. Coordinating publicity efforts within a tight timeframe, he actively listened to different perspectives, ensuring a smooth and well-received event.</p>
	
<p>"Being part of Student Council exposed me to leadership competencies I had never considered before. It taught me the importance of teamwork, accountability, and understanding different leadership styles," Jayden reflected. He also worked closely with his fellow Executive Committee (EXCO) members to plan and execute leadership workshops in collaboration with Choa Chu Kang Secondary School, fostering meaningful exchanges between student leaders.</p>

<p>Ms. Audrey Aw, Jayden’s Civics tutor and Student Council Teacher Advisor, described him as resilient, confident, and driven. She recalled that in his leadership position, Jayden encountered challenges when team members were either difficult or not putting in their best effort. Instead of placing blame, he consistently demonstrated empathy, choosing to lead by example and fill the gaps himself. “His ability to step up and show commitment inspires those around him, encouraging them to do better and fostering a stronger sense of teamwork,” Ms. Aw shared.</p>

<p>From a Civics tutor’s perspective, Ms. Aw admired Jayden’s unwavering optimism, noting, “Jayden has always been a supportive and kind peer to his classmates and fellow Student Councillors. I have never seen him view his physical difference as an obstacle. In fact, it is not something that stands out in his daily interactions—his confidence and determination define him far more than any challenge ever could.”</p>

<p>Beyond college, Jayden devoted himself to community service, participating in Meet-The-People Sessions (MTPS) in his constituency. This experience opened his eyes to the complexities of policymaking and the challenges faced by residents seeking assistance. "Listening to residents' concerns gave me a deeper understanding of the issues on the ground. I realised that solutions aren’t always straightforward and that careful consideration is required to ensure fairness and sustainability," he said.</p>

<p>His commitment to community outreach extended to Values-In-Action (VIA) projects, where he and his classmates raised awareness about animal cruelty. Seeing residents engage in the activities they had planned reinforced his belief in the power of service. "When people find joy and purpose in the initiatives we organise, it fuels my passion to keep giving back," Jayden shared.</p>

<p>Jayden’s experiences in JPJC have solidified his aspirations for the future. Looking ahead, he aspires to pursue Environmental Science or Political Science in university. His passion for sustainability and governance aligns with his long-term goal of serving the community and creating lasting change, either as an environmentalist or an educator. "I want to contribute to shaping a better future, whether by nurturing the next generation or advocating for sustainable practices," he said.</p>

<p>As he prepares for the next chapter of his journey, Jayden remains grounded in the values that have shaped him—resilience, inclusivity, and a growth mindset. His advice for navigating the demands of college life is simple yet profound: “Your challenges don’t define you — your determination does. Never let anything limit what you can achieve. Prioritisation is key. Learn to distinguish between what needs immediate attention and what can wait. More importantly, build a strong support system — friends, family, and mentors who can guide you through difficult times. And most of all, cherish every moment in college. These memories will become the foundation that carries you forward.”</p>

<p>Jayden’s story is one of courage, perseverance, and unwavering optimism. In overcoming challenges head-on and giving back to those around him, he truly embodies the spirit of JPJC’s anthem: "Brave the odds, blaze the trails."</p>
