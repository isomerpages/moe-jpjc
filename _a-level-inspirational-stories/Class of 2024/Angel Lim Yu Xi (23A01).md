<b><h5>Beyond the Canvas: Angel’s love for the Arts and Humanities</h5></b>

<p>As the only Arts student in her cohort taking four H2 subjects, Angel Lim Yu Xi, a student from Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) often found herself navigating an academic path that few others walked. On top of that, managing a packed schedule of Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), Values-in-Action (VIA) projects, and leadership commitments required careful balance. Yet, through it all, Angel remained steadfast—driven not just by ambition, but by a deep-seated belief in contributing meaningfully to her college and community.</p>

<p>Angel had always been drawn to the humanities. A self-professed introvert, she spent much of her childhood immersed in books, sketchpads, and online worlds, where she could explore different perspectives and cultures. Geography, in particular, captured her imagination. She loved reading about niche traditions and geological phenomena, fascinated by how the world was shaped both physically and socially. When she came across the Direct School Admission - Humanities Programme at Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC), it felt like a natural fit.</p>

<p>“To be completely honest, I first considered JPJC simply because it was within walking distance from my house,” she admitted with a laugh. “But what sealed the decision was the chance to pursue the Humanities Programme and be surrounded by like-minded individuals.” What started as a practical choice became a deeply fulfilling journey—one that she wouldn’t trade for any other school.</p>

<p>Angel took on the challenge of four H2 subjects—not because she had a specific goal in mind, but because she genuinely enjoyed learning. “Most people take 4H2s for university admissions, but I did it simply because I was interested in all my subjects and didn’t want to limit my options,” she said. The workload was demanding, but what she struggled with most was the sense of isolation. “Having to adjust entire class schedules just to fit my timetable made me feel like an inconvenience at times,” she admitted. But with the unwavering support of her teachers and classmates, she found ways to navigate the challenges.</p>

<p>Her Economics tutor, Mr. Chu Hian Meng, described her as “diligent, determined, and reserved.” She was not the type to seek the spotlight, but she put in consistent effort and persevered through the rigour of the A-Level curriculum. Her Literature in English tutor, Ms. Zaleena, recalled how Angel transformed over the two years: “She didn’t have the best start in J1, but she made a conscious effort to push herself in her second year. She’s incredibly insightful and creative in her interpretations.” Similarly, her Civics and Geography tutor, Mdm. Gunaselvi, described her as “perceptive and wise beyond her years,” while her Mathematics tutor, Ms. Yew Lee Yin, noted how she “knows when to push herself and when to seek help.”</p>

<p>Beyond the classroom, her passion for the arts found a home in her CCA PlayArt, where she took on the role of Logistics Head. From organising events to leading creative initiatives, she was deeply involved in shaping the club’s direction. One of her proudest moments was conducting a plushie-making workshop for the Green Bazaar, where PlayArt members taught the wider student body how to repurpose one-use styrofoam into soft toys. “Seeing the skills we learned in CCA being applied in a real-world context was incredibly fulfilling,” she shared.</p>

<p>Angel always believed that art has the power to inspire, connect, and give voice to the unseen. For Angel, art was more than just a passion—it became her medium for making a difference. In her journey at JPJC, Angel wore many hats: artist, leader, volunteer, and scholar. Whether she was spearheading PlayArt’s projects, designing the college’s Student Handbook, or leading community initiatives, Angel brought creativity and heart to everything she did.</p>

<p>Angel’s artistic talents left a lasting imprint on the college that went beyond PlayArt. In 2024, she was entrusted with designing the Student Handbook, a task that required both creative vision and meticulous attention to detail. She worked tirelessly to ensure that the illustrations reflected the diverse student population while incorporating subtle Easter eggs that made it uniquely JP. “It was a challenge balancing this with other commitments, but I wanted it to be something students could relate to and be proud of,” she said.</p>

<p>Her CCA teacher, Ms. Chong Woon Hui, saw firsthand how Angel’s leadership and dedication shaped PlayArt into a more cohesive and engaged CCA. “She wasn’t just an active and dependable member—she set the tone for how the club functioned,” Ms. Chong shared. “She worked so well with the President and Vice-President, ensuring that events ran smoothly, but what stood out most was how she took the initiative to connect PlayArt with meaningful volunteering opportunities. She was always looking for ways to expand the club’s reach beyond just school activities.”</p>

<p>Leadership came naturally to Angel, though she never saw herself as the loud, authoritative type. Instead, she led through quiet confidence, dedication, and a strong sense of responsibility to those around her. As a member of the Scholars Development Programme (SDP), she had the opportunity to helm a large-scale community event at Keat Hong Community Club—a carnival for over 300 residents. Managing an event of that scale was no easy feat, from coordinating manpower to liaising with vendors. She made mistakes along the way, but the experience was invaluable.</p>

<p>“What made it special was how everyone—my friends from CCA, classmates, and SDP teammates—chipped in. It really showed me how interconnected all my communities in JPJC were,” she reflected. She credits her SDP alumni advisors, Bridget Tan and Daryl Lee, for guiding her through the leadership learning curve, offering not just practical advice but also encouragement when the weight of responsibilities felt overwhelming.</p>

<p>Her involvement in community work extended beyond school-organised VIA projects. She sought out her own opportunities, working closely with diverse beneficiaries—from the elderly to families and even animal welfare organisations. “I realised that for many elderly residents, it’s not grand events they appreciate most, but simple conversations,” she shared. “A lot of them just want someone to talk to, to share stories with younger people who may otherwise pass them by. That was something I saw firsthand when we visited single-room rental flats, going door-to-door to pass out care packages. It was meaningful to both the volunteers and the elderly.”</p>

<p>Her work with families at community events was equally fulfilling. “Families tend to be more flexible in the type of events they enjoy, whether it’s sports, crafts, or tech-based activities. The most meaningful events are those that teach children something new, something they can take away and apply beyond that one day,” she said. Her role in organising Keat Hong Countdown 2024 cemented this belief. “Seeing families of all backgrounds enjoying an event that took months of planning—it made all the effort worth it.”</p>

<p>Aside from such community events, Angel’s perspectives were further broadened through overseas exchange programme in Tokyo, Japan. “I was fascinated by their urban planning, their infrastructure, and how they integrate disaster preparedness into everyday life. Walking through the streets at night, just watching how people navigate their lives—that was a moment that really stayed with me. Understanding another culture isn’t just about reading or visiting landmarks; it’s about putting yourself in their shoes, even for a short while.”</p>

<p>Through all her experiences, Angel remained grounded in the support of her family. “I’m fortunate to have parents and loved ones who don’t pressure me to excel but support me in everything I do. That’s given me a much healthier relationship with success,” she reflected. “It’s not about proving something to anyone—it’s about making them proud in my own way.”</p>

<p>Angel also credits JPJC for shaping her into the person she is today. “The amount of opportunities available—from overseas exchanges to leadership programmes—helped me develop in ways I never expected,” she said. But more than the experiences, it was the relationships she built that defined her time in JC. Her classmate and close friend, Diana Zhao, was her constant source of support. “She was my anchor through all the ups and downs. No matter how burnt out I was, I knew I could count on her to sit with me at recess and just talk about life,” Angel shared.</p>

<p>With A-Levels behind her, Angel now looks ahead to university, hoping to pursue a degree in the humanities and possibly secure a bonded scholarship to ease the financial burden on her family. “I don’t have everything figured out yet, but I know I want to work with people, understand their environments and cultures, and make an impact in whatever way I can,” she shared. To her juniors, she offers a piece of advice: “Put in your best and build momentum from J1, and keep trying even if the results don’t show it. Be proactive in signing up for opportunities that interest you, even if you think you won’t get them—the last thing you want is the lingering regret of wondering, ‘what if?”</p>

<p>For Angel, success has never been about loud accolades or public recognition. It has always been about quiet, meaningful contributions—the ones that leave a lasting impression long after the paint has dried and the canvases have been put away. In the words of her Civics tutor, “True greatness doesn’t need to shout—it shines quietly, just like her.”</p>
