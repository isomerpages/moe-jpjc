<b><h5>Rising Above: Jolene’s Journey of Resilience</h5></b>

<p>Jolene Wang Jing Yi, a student from Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC), had always known that the junior college path would be rigorous, but nothing quite prepared her for the emotional toll it would take. By the time she reached JC1 in 2021, she found herself drowning in a sea of expectations, struggling to keep pace with the relentless academic demands. Anxiety, which had begun creeping in during her secondary school years, gripped her more tightly than ever, manifesting in ways she could not fully control. Her mind raced through deadlines and responsibilities, doubting her subject combinations and the pressure of project work only made things worse. The stress became overwhelming, and without an outlet to properly process it.</p>
	
<p>The college recognised her struggles early on and stepped in with support. They paired her with classmates who looked out for her, offering encouragement when she needed it most. She would also meet the school counsellor on a regular basis to talk things out. But as the year wore on, her anxiety deepened. Missing her Mid-Year Examinations was a tipping point—by then, every school day felt like an insurmountable hurdle. She felt physically and mentally exhausted. When she finally made the difficult decision to withdraw from JC1, she knew she needed time away to regain her footing.  “I am extremely grateful to the college for allowing me to defer my education and recognising that I was not in the best headspace to take up the rigorous workload of JC in 2021.”</p>
	
<p>Taking a year off, she used the time to reflect on what she truly wanted and, more importantly, how she could better cope with the pressures of junior college life. That year away was an opportunity for healing and self-discovery. She took up part-time work, stepping into the real world in a way she never had before. It was daunting at first—learning to interact with different people, managing responsibilities, and coming to terms with the fact that she had paused her academic journey while her peers moved forward. Recharged by spending quality time with parents, she finally realised that she just needed to move at her own pace.</p>
	
<p>Returning to JPJC in 2023 with a different subject combination was not an easy decision. She knew it meant confronting old fears while she restarted her journey. But this time, Jolene was stronger, more prepared. The year away had given her the resilience she needed to face challenges head-on. She walked into the classroom with renewed determination, ready to prove to herself that she could persevere. She threw herself into her studies, excelling in Literature, where her love for analysis and interpretation shone through. Jolene had always been intelligent and independent, but now she was better equipped to channel her strengths. She earned the Best JC1 Academic Performance in H2 English Literature award in 2023. “I’ve always loved literature—it’s a space where I can immerse myself in different perspectives, understand emotions, and make sense of the world,” she shared. “I think that being genuinely interested in a subject helped me in terms of performance.”</p>
	
<p>Jolene also took on leadership roles, serving as the Chinese Language B Subject Representative in JC1 and later as the Art Subject Representative in JC2. These roles, though outside her comfort zone, helped her build confidence. She realised that leadership was not about being the loudest in the room but about showing quiet strength and dependability.</p>
	
<p>Outside the classroom, Jolene found herself drawn to the International Current Affairs Society (ICAS), where she expanded her understanding of global issues. “I have always been interested in staying informed about global events, and ICAS provided a fantastic opportunity to deepen my understanding of the world while also benefiting my General Paper essays. Being part of ICAS was incredibly enjoyable, as my CCA mates were like-minded and driven. The topics shared by the Session Planners were insightful and genuinely fascinating to explore,” said Jolene. Stepping into the role of Deputy Publicity Head, she worked on outreach initiatives, refining her ability to communicate and engage audiences. “To me, true leadership is about inspiring and guiding a group toward growth by recognising and nurturing each member’s strengths, enabling them to work together as a cohesive team,” she shared. In 2024, she took on an even bigger challenge—serving as Deputy Secretary General (Publicity) for the Jurong Pioneer Model United Nations (JPMUN). She honed her leadership and communication skills, working closely with peers to promote key events. “JPMUN was an eye-opening experience that gave us hands-on involvement in planning and executing an inter-school event. Seeing the delegates from JPJC and participating secondary schools enjoy the event gave me a deep sense of achievement, making all our efforts feel truly worthwhile.”</p>
	
<p>Her involvement in college life did not stop there. She stepped up as an emcee for the Inter-House Games and the Annual Road Run, events that required her to speak confidently in front of large crowds. “My heart was racing when I stepped up to the mic. But as I started speaking, I focused on the energy of the event, and it became easier. By the end, I actually enjoyed it.” The experience left her with a newfound confidence in public speaking, something she never imagined she would develop.</p>
	
<p>Additionally, she played a key role in the Cyber-wellness Carnival, an experience that allowed her to connect with others on meaningful issues such as promoting responsible digital habits among students. She also participated in external programmes such as the Global Youth Leaders’ Summit and the Literature Symposium, which further broadened her worldview. She learned to appreciate the power of discourse, the importance of different narratives, and the beauty of diverse perspectives.</p>
	
<p>Through it all, the college remained a pillar of support. "She wasn’t just a student who left and came back—She was someone I believed in,” shared one of Jolene’s teachers. Looking back, Jolene was grateful for how JPJC had accommodated her journey. Jolene was especially grateful to Mdm Gunaselvi who talked to her and helped her to find coping mechanisms. “Teachers played a huge role in my growth, guiding me patiently and encouraging me to embrace challenges.”</p>
	
<p>“Resilience is not the absence of struggle, but the strength to rise, learn, and flourish anew—just like Jolene, who transformed her challenges into stepping stones for success,” praised Mdm Gunaselvi.</p>
	
<p>Despite her growth, the road was never completely smooth. There were still moments when anxiety crept in, whispering doubts into her mind. But this time, Jolene had the tools to manage it. She reminded herself of how far she had come, of the strength she had built over time. More importantly, she had people who believed in her—her teachers, who had supported her through the deferment process, and her parents, whose unwavering hard work inspired her to keep going. “I am deeply grateful for the unwavering support of my JC friends from 2021, who stood by me through thick and thin, always ready with encouragement and valuable advice. The friends I met in 2023 were equally supportive, never hesitating to lend a listening ear or assist me with topics I found challenging.” She knows that resilience is an ongoing journey, not a destination and it’s about having the strength to rise, learn, and flourish anew.</p>
	
<p>Looking ahead, Jolene is drawn to the fields of Criminology and Psychology, where she hopes to understand human behaviour on a deeper level. She also wants to pick up new hobbies, to continue learning beyond academics, and to embrace life’s challenges with an open heart.</p>

<p>When asked what advice she would give to others facing similar struggles, she thought for a moment before replying, “Make new friends, enjoy new experiences to enrich your college life, and look for opportunities to grow and mature as an individual. Revise regularly to prevent unnecessary stress towards exams and remember to take adequate breaks to rest.”</p>

<p>As she prepares for the next chapter of her life, she carries with her the lessons JPJC has imparted—the value of perseverance, the importance of self-belief, and the unwavering support of a community that never gave up on her. " I see setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow,” she shared. Setbacks are just detours leading Jolene to a version of herself she is proud of today.</p>
