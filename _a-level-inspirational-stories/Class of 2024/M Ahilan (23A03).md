<b><h5>Rising Above Challenges to Give Back - Turnaround student with a BIG heart for the community</h5></b>

<p>When M Ahilan, a student from Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC), first entered junior college, he struggled to adapt to the rigorous JC curriculum. “I lacked the discipline to sit down and focus, and I didn’t ask for help when I needed it,” he admitted. The academic challenges took a toll on him, and he was ultimately told that he had to repeat his first year — a moment that felt like a heavy blow to his confidence. Despite this, his parents remained supportive, urging him to learn from his mistakes rather than dwell on them. While this was a difficult and disheartening moment, it became a turning point in Ahilan’s life.</p>

<p>Ahilan embraced his second chance not only by persevering to do better in his studies but also by immersing himself in opportunities to grow as an individual. While many of his peers would have closed themselves in and focused on themselves even more, Ahilan looked even more outwards instead. He started to participate actively in community service and clocked over 400 hours of volunteer work. Service to others became a defining aspect of his journey. Having personally benefited from community initiatives as a child, he felt a deep responsibility to give back and he did so not only through school-led Values-In-Action (VIA) projects but actively sought opportunities for himself beyond the college. “I still have my medal from the time I participated in the Keat Hong Sports Carnival when I was still in primary school, participating in such community events left a deep impact in me and I wanted to do the same for others,” Ahilan shared.</p> 

<p>Unlike other young people who might prefer to spend time in front of their computers or gaming, his weekends and leisure time were filled with volunteering projects. He started actively volunteering at Keat Hong Community Club, working as a case writer during Meet-the-People Sessions and assisted residents in voicing their concerns to relevant agencies. “Every story was a reminder of how much impact a listening ear and a helping hand could make,” he reflected. “It wasn’t just paperwork—it was about standing with the community and ensuring their voices were heard.” He also enjoyed the time volunteering so much so that to him it was something that helped him take his mind off the stresses at school. “I do have other things I do to destress as well, but volunteering was the most meaningful for me.”</p>

<p>One of his most impactful experiences was Project Boundless—a 14-day service-learning trip to Tra Vinh Province, Vietnam. Alongside his peers, he built homes for families in need, taught in local schools, and experienced first-hand the power of service. “Although there was a language barrier, it didn’t stop us from connecting with the community,” he reflected. “It was a humbling experience that reinforced my belief in the impact of small acts of kindness. I took a photo with the family I built the home for, and I still have it with me till today as a reminder of the impact I can have on the community.” Ahilan also took on the role of an organiser for a children’s camp at Keat Hong. He meticulously planned and executed activities designed to bring joy and learning to children in the community. “Seeing the smiles on their faces after a day of games, storytelling, and mentorship reminded me why I do what I do,” he shared. “Many of these children reminded me of my younger self, and I hope that my contribution can leave a positive impact on them.”</p>

<p>This renewed sense of purpose to serve others translated into a similar commitment and determination in his studies. By honing his self-regulation skills and maintaining a growth mindset, he made consistent academic improvements. Determined to prove himself, Ahilan set clear goals: to stay consistent in his revision, complete all assignments diligently, and seek help when needed. With guidance and support of his teachers and friends, he developed a structured study approach - Pre-lesson preparation, consultations and post-lesson review. His diligence and commitment to understanding concepts deeply became the pillars of his academic turnaround. In fact, Ahilan made marked improvement in all his subjects. Particularly, from barely passing H2 History, he made steady progress for the subject and attained a B in JC2, a major improvement considering the challenges he faced in his first-year transitioning into JC. Despite the copious number of notes for the subject, he always looked forward to his History lessons as his interest in the subject grew over the years thanks to his History teacher, Ms Nur Adhana Anwar, who made the subject come alive. Ms Nur Adhana spoke highly of him, “Ahilan exemplified proactiveness, resilience and inquisitiveness in his approach to learning. From the outset, he took the initiative to seek consultations and actively engage with feedback, demonstrating a strong desire to refine his understanding and improve his performance. His resilience was evident in the way he tackled setbacks. He never allowed initial struggles to deter him.”</p>

<p>Ahilan also discovered a new avenue for growth in leadership and sports. He made a bold decision to switch his Co-Curricular Activities to Taekwondo in his second year, drawn by the camaraderie and challenge it presented. With prior experience in the sport, he saw an opportunity to contribute and grow. Rising to the role of captain, he sought to instil a strong sense of discipline and competitiveness within the team. Ahilan believes that true leadership is not about outpacing competitors but about growing alongside them, recognising that collaboration can drive improvement and excellence. Guided by this philosophy, he initiated joint training sessions with other colleges, including Raffles Institution’s Taekwondo team in 2024. He saw an opportunity for mutual learning, where both teams could refine their techniques through sparring and shared insights. The presence of a Taekwondo master coach further enriched the experience, providing expert guidance to both colleges.</p> 

<p>Beyond just training, the session fostered camaraderie and strengthened inter-school networks, embodying Ahilan’s belief that competition should be a force that elevates rather than divides. This was indeed an enriching and unique experience for his team members. His leadership paid off when JPJC’s Taekwondo team secured a historic 4th place in the Boys’ Category in the National School Games—an achievement that underscored his dedication and belief in his team’s potential. Mdm Lorena Ibrahim, the Taekwondo teacher-in-charge highlighted how he has the heart for other even as the captain of Taekwondo, “Ahilan always put the team’s well-being first, guiding our members with a positive attitude and his unwavering support. His work ethic and positive outlook inspire all members to push their limits and strive for excellence. He was really the backbone of our team.”</p>

<p>Ahilan credits his growth to the unwavering support of his teachers and the abundant opportunities given to him in JPJC, “I am very grateful to the college for believing in me. As a student at JPJC I was always surrounded by teachers who went the extra mile and even teachers who were willing to give me consultations several times a week during the study break in the lead up to the A-levels. At the same time, I could also share my worries and stresses with my teachers. I am grateful for the many opportunities that I had and the support I was given throughout my time in JPJC.” Among the many opportunities given to Ahilan, he was also the opportunity to be an Orientation Group Leader in JC2, where he had to help the new JC1s adapt and assimilate to the the new JC environment. Ahilan was also the external Vice House Captain where he contributed to building a stronger college culture within the house that he served for. On top of that, he was also given the opportunity to go on a global exchange trip to Surabaya which broadened his cultural awareness and international relations. Through these opportunities, Ahilan believes he has benefited greatly from learning experientially.</p> 

<p>He is particularly grateful to his teachers, Ms. Adhana Anwar, his History teacher; Mr. Koh Chit Siong, his Year Head and mentor and Ms. Teong Li Dan, his form teacher and Economics tutor. “Ms. Ana was always encouraging me to do better for History. Mr. Koh always emphasised the importance of showing up as he told us that there was always something to learn if we give ourselves that opportunity to learn. Ms. Teong, on the other hand, went beyond academics— She was always there to provide me with a listening ear, sometimes even coming early before assembly to have a chat with me. This simple act really lightened the burdens I was feeling at times because I had trusted adults to talk with. These teachers went the extra mile and inspired me to be even better,” he said with gratitude. His teachers’ unwavering support gave him the confidence to persevere, even in moments of self-doubt. Ms. Teong, in particular, saw in him a quiet strength and resilience. “Ahilan consistently maintains a positive learning attitude, even when he underperformed. He demonstrates maturity beyond his age and truly serves as an exemplary role model of good character.”</p>

<p>Ahilan’s advice to those struggling in school, “Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Make honest self-assessments and work towards your goals with discipline. Play hard, but study even harder. When you can, look beyond yourself—see where you can make a difference in your community.” Ahilan hopes to pursue a degree in Political Science or International Relations and aspires to serve the nation as a regular in the Singapore Army. His JC experience has shaped his perspective on leadership, resilience, and service. He spoke of his future plans - “I want to continue making a difference, whether in my career or my community. If not me, then who?” he mused.</p>
