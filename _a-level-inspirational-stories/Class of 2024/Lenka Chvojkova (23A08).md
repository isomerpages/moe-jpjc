<b><h5>Thriving with ADHD: Transforming Challenges into Triumphs in Junior College</h5></b>

<p>Lenka Chvojkova, a student from Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) looks like any other cheerful teenager, but beneath this bubbly demeanour many may not realise her invisible struggle with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) – a learning need that requires specific strategies to overcome it. While adjusting to junior college could be challenging for most students, it was even more so for Lenka. The fast-paced academic environment, heavier workload, and need for greater concentration left her feeling overwhelmed while she had to manage her inability to focus and need to consistently be on the move.</p>

<p>Like most students with ADHD, Lenka had always been an energetic and sociable child especially in primary school. But as she entered secondary school, her experience shifted dramatically. What had once been celebrated as enthusiasm now made her feel out of place. “I realised I had to reinvent myself,” Lenka recalls. “The version of me that was celebrated in primary school wasn’t fitting in anymore. I needed to learn when to hold back, even though I still remain bubbly at heart.” Lenka faced increasing difficulties with concentration and organisation, and as academic demands intensified, she found herself falling behind. It was not until Secondary 3 that she was diagnosed with ADHD—a revelation that finally explained the challenges she had been facing for years. Although the diagnosis provided clarity, it also meant she had to find new ways to adapt. “Understanding what was different about me was the first step to managing it,” she explains. With this insight, Lenka began to experiment with new coping mechanisms, realising that her learning style required a tailored approach: she needed to see and hear information in a way that suited her dynamic mind, often resorting to massive mind maps, A5 planners, and even speaking out loud to reinforce her studies.</p>

<p>When she entered JPJC, despite the challenges she faced, Lenka felt she was not alone in her struggles. “Initially, JPJC wasn’t my first choice. However, a visit to the Open House completely changed my perspective. I was impressed by the warm, welcoming vibe that reminded me of my primary school days. Meeting JPJC’s principal, Mr. Ang, and experiencing the genuine connections within the school community made me feel right at home.” The inclusive ‘JPFam’ culture, combined with an environment that valued collaboration and holistic development over cutthroat competition, provided Lenka the space to rediscover her identity and rebuild her confidence. The college’s support system, including a programme to Special Educational Needs (SEN), played a crucial role in helping her navigate junior college life. She was paired with Mr. Azri, JPJC’s dedicated SEN Officer, who worked closely with her to develop personalised strategies to enhance her learning experience. He introduced her to structured planning tools, such as digital scheduling apps and detailed checklists, which helped her break down her workload into manageable tasks. Recognising that traditional study methods were not always effective for her, Mr. Azri encouraged Lenka to experiment with visual aids, discussion-based learning, and interactive revision sessions. Periodic check-ins provided her with a safe space to discuss her progress and challenges, and adjustments were made to help her find the best study methods that suited her dynamic thinking process. “Mr. Azri became my go-to person. Every two weeks, we’d meet for a session where I could simply vent and work through the pressures that were overwhelming me,” she shares. In these sessions, Mr. Azri’s approach was both methodical and compassionate. He not only listened to her frustrations but also provided tailored strategies to cope with exam anxiety; a recurring issue for Lenka, whose perfectionist tendencies often led her to fixate on every detail.  “After the prelims, I was so anxious during exams that I couldn’t move on from one question to the next,” Lenka admits. “Mr. Azri gave me a comprehensive list of exam strategies, breaking down the content into manageable steps and teaching me how to progress without getting stuck in the pursuit of perfection.”</p>

<p>Teachers also went the extra mile to support Lenka. For example, Ms Zaleena uncovered the root cause of Lenka’s exam anxiety and reassured her of the content knowledge which she already possessed that allowed her to work on productive steps for exam management. Mr Sufian’s Physical Education lessons were always a welcome respite from the long lessons in classrooms as it allowed her to disperse her pent-up energy. Mr Sufian also made it a point to constantly check-in on her one-to-one to ensure that she was not feeling overwhelmed by the events in school. The flexibility and patience the teachers demonstrated allowed Lenka to adapt her learning in a way that made sense to her. With time, Lenka not only adjusted to junior college life but also began to thrive. Rather than seeing her ADHD as a hindrance, she embraced its unique advantages. Her hyperfocus, when channelled correctly, allowed her to excel in areas that demanded creativity and spontaneity. This was evident in her active involvement in the JPJC Literature Symposium, where she took on a leading role in a dramatic performance that showcased her ability to think on her feet and engage audiences dynamically. Additionally, her participation in the Creative Arts Programme highlighted her ability to generate fresh, unconventional ideas—an aspect of her ADHD that she learned to appreciate and leverage.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, Lenka also found that her boundless energy can be asset as she thrived in fast-paced, interactive settings, where her enthusiasm and quick adaptability allowed her to contribute meaningfully. One such aspect which she thrived in was her Co-curricular Activities – Touch Rugby. As she had to follow a structured training programme, that somehow helped Lenka in becoming more disciplined and focused. Teachers and peers alike admired her resilience and ability to turn challenges into strengths. Rather than allowing ADHD to define her struggles, she redefined it as a unique perspective that enabled her to think differently, problem-solve creatively, and push boundaries in meaningful ways. She even pushed herself beyond her comfort zone by taking up leadership roles as the Class Manager for her class in both her years in JC. As a Class Manager, her own challenges became avenues for her to empathise with the struggles of her classmates, though it may be different from hers. Lenka’s Civics Tutor Mr Sufian shares that she was not only a reliable Class Manager but also how she was exemplary in the way she conducted herself, never letting her special needs overshadow her capability as a Class Manager.</p>  

<p>For many students with special needs, disclosing their diagnosis can be a daunting decision. Some may fear being judged or misunderstood, while others worry about being perceived as incapable of keeping up with academic demands. ADHD, in particular, is often misunderstood, with misconceptions that those diagnosed with it are lazy or cannot learn effectively or succeed in structured environments. Lenka, however, chose to be open about her condition with her peers and teachers. Rather than seeing it as a weakness, she viewed it as a unique aspect of her identity that shaped her learning experience. By sharing her experiences, she not only helped demystify ADHD but also encouraged others to be more understanding and accepting. Her willingness to be transparent about her struggles and triumphs made her an inspiration to those around her, proving that a diagnosis does not define one's capabilities or potential.</p>

<p>Lenka’s journey at JPJC has not only shaped her academically but has also inspired her future aspirations. With a deep passion for language and communication, she hopes to pursue a degree in Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh. She envisions a future where she can apply her insights into language and cognition to fields such as translation, authorship, journalism, or even forensic linguistics. She also hopes that more will be aware of the struggles that students with special learning needs face and that more support both academically and socially can be given to students to overcome the social stigma that some may have of such students.</p> 

<p>Her journey serves as a powerful reminder that with the right support, determination, and mindset, students with learning challenges can not only cope but also thrive. Her advice for those with special learning needs, “If you’re struggling, don’t be afraid to ask for help. There’s always a way forward—you just have to find the approach that works for you.”</p>
