<h5>With the discovery of his unique talent in Mathematics and Physics, Michael Hoon Yong Hau (18S19) is ready to take on the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</h5>

<p>
Michael Hoon made a quantum leap when he enrolled in JPJC. Admitting that he struggled with his studies in primary and lower secondary, he changed his attitude in upper secondary as he realized that he needed to work hard to achieve his goals. When he entered JPJC, his teachers discovered his gift in Mathematics and passion for Physics and he seized the opportunities offered to him, such as the Nanyang Research Programme (NRP) and H3 Physics.</p>

<p>
In the NRP, he designed, built and tested a 3UCubeSat, for which he obtained a Silver Award. His NRP teacher-mentor at JPJC, Mr Edwin Lim, commented that, ‘Michael is a student who is gifted and shows a great deal of passion in Mathematics and Science. I find him curious and constantly inquisitive about scientific knowledge and questions. We engaged in frequent discussions and conversations about his project, and he came across as sharp and being able to grasp new concepts quickly.’ Michael’s passion was also piqued by the “interesting and engaging” Physics lessons conducted by his Physics tutor Mr Tan Soon Hong, who would frequently bring the class to the Feynman Lab, where they got to experiment with the many set-ups and equipment.</p>

<p>
Despite being described by his teachers as hardworking and gifted, Michael nevertheless found the JC curriculum to be challenging, especially in H3 Physics. He had to quickly learn how to manage his time. He also had to learn to balance his academic studies and co-curricular commitments. However, Michael had always looked forward to going to school, because of his close friendships with his peers and strong relationship with his teachers.</p>

<p>
Of his future, Michael is keen to pursue computer engineering and Artificial Intelligence, an area that is still in its nascent stage. “I am really keen to be involved in research and development in areas that can help Singapore’s progress into becoming a digitalised and SMART nation.” With his passion and aptitude for Math and Physics, Michael applied for early admission into the Singapore University for Technology and Design’s (SUTD) new course in design and AI, the first of its kind in Singapore, and was selected by SUTD. Notably, he was also offered early admission into NTU.</p>

<p>
Coming from a supportive home, Michael hopes to obtain a scholarship to lessen the financial burden on his family.</p></div>
