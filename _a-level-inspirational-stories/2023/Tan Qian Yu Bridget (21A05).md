<figcaption> Having spent all her growing years away from Singapore, Tan Qian Yu Bridget (21A05) returned to pursue her A Levels in JPJC and found ‘home’, having the opportunity to grow roots and serve the community both in college, and beyond.</figcaption></figure>

<p>While most of her peers experienced general hesitations on coming to a new school for the next phase of their post-secondary education, Bridget experienced another layer of anxiousness.  “I remember feeling very nervous on my way to college on the first day. I told myself to observe those around me and try to adapt accordingly since I did not know what to expect and felt unprepared.” Bridget was about to experience the Singapore school system for the very first time. Her father’s business was based in China and she had studied exclusively in international schools in Beijing and Shanghai since the age of two. Coming to Singapore was a whole new experience for her, let alone having to adjust to the Singapore education system.</p>

<p>As she was planning to pursue her university education in Singapore, her parents decided to let her complete college here. She had to adapt to a new culture; even home was unfamiliar. All alone in a ‘foreign’ land without her parents, Bridget stayed with her aunt, sharing a room with her cousin. Her parents were to return to Singapore earlier to join Bridget but were held back by the raging pandemic and repeated lockdowns in Shanghai. The family reunion took more than a year, by which Bridget was in the middle of her second year, with the A Levels looming near.</p>

<p>Having spent all her growing years in another country, adjusting came to be rather challenging. Looking back, she recalled a particular incident, “In my first week here, I was walking to buy a thermometer at the bookshop and the national anthem started playing. It did not occur to me to stop until I felt something was amiss. I was caught off guard as this was different from my experience in the international school.”</p>

<p>The uncertainty was stressful. At times, it was so distressing that her heart would race and cause her to feel light-headed. The college came together to provide support for her during this difficult period. Her teachers, school counsellors and even the Vice Principals checked in to see how she was doing. “I am thankful for the caring teachers whom I met here in JPJC, especially Mdm Gunaselvi who was a motherly figure and checked in on the class often; Ms Zaleena who showed us tough love and shaped my perspectives on Literature, Ms Yeoh who made PE lessons so fun and engaging after a long day of lessons in school; and my CCA teachers who gave me opportunities that I am thankful for.”</p>

<p>Bridget’s choice of CCA was a unique one. After spending almost her entire life overseas, Bridget yearned to get in touch with her Singaporean roots. She joined the Community Engagement Council, a niche student leadership CCA involved in planning and organising key National Education events for the college. Bridget desired to gain a better understanding of her roots and what being a Singaporean truly meant.</p>

<p>The planning of these events was largely student-directed under the mentorship of the teachers-in-charge. These experiences enabled Bridget to forge her Singaporean identity. “As I was planning for National Day and Racial Harmony Day, I was also learning at the same time. Technically, it was my first experience participating in these national celebrations. Through participating in CEC workshops, I also came to appreciate the importance of multiracial harmony, which is often taken for granted.”</p>

<p>Her passion, enthusiasm and evident leadership skills saw her being elected as the CEC President and she played a key role in many college wide events. “I am grateful that the college and my CCA teachers recognised my abilities and gave me the opportunity to lead though I myself was learning more about Singapore and discovering my Singaporean identity at that time.”</p>

<p>Her eloquence and confidence in speaking to a large audience further led to her being selected to host college events such as the National Day Celebrations 2021, Service Learning Festival 2022 and J2 SG Perspectives with Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How in 2022. “I acquired a lot of skills as I developed an awareness on how to be flexible, adaptable and to think on my feet. I wouldn’t have been able to experience these opportunities if we hadn’t decided to pursue my college education in Singapore and JPJC.”</p>

<p>Fascinated by her newly found identity, Bridget spends her free time exploring Singapore on her own, discovering iconic places and unique food that her peers had grown up to be so familiar with. She was eager to catch up with all that she had missed and to make up for lost time. “It was during these journeys that I discovered what the Singaporean kampung spirit means. It had poured unexpectedly, and I did not have my umbrella with me. A random ‘aunty’ came by my side and simply shared her umbrella as we were walking. On another instance, I had left my wallet on the table at the coffee shop, and another ‘aunty’ advised me to keep it close should it get stolen. This is what community spirit is about, strangers looking out for one another.” She grew to appreciate her nation more and finally felt a sense of belonging despite being absent for so many years. “When I was young, we were moving around quite a bit, so I never really felt attached to any place. But after coming here, I felt a sense of rootedness, inclusiveness and I finally felt ... at home.” Bridget also longed to give back to the very place that she now calls home. She devoted time to serve the Singapore community through her participation in various Values in Action (VIA) projects. She participated in Project Appreciation for our Unsung Heroes where she assisted to plan and pack hampers for the hidden heroes in the school community such as the cleaners and security guards. In addition, she took on the role of the Deputy Sector Leader for the organising committee of Sunday Funday at Kranji Recreational Centre which was organised for migrant workers. “Through participation in such projects, I was able to interact with people from all walks of life in Singapore, which was meaningful to me as well,” she mentioned.</p>

<p>When asked what her source of strength and motivation was to make the best of a challenging situation, she credited her parents. “My parents were both from low-income families. They had a difficult life and did not complete university education. In fact, they both met when they were working in McDonalds as managers and now with hard work and determination, they are doing well running their own business. Through them, I learnt to value the importance of hard work. This motivated me to achieve my dream of going university ever since I was a little girl.” Bridget hopes to pursue Economics in the newly launched National University of Singapore College.</p>

<p>Just like the lyrics of a beloved National Day Song goes, “There is comfort in the knowledge that home’s about its people too,” a line Bridget cites as her favourite for she has found home not just as a place that makes her feel safe and comfortable but through the very people she met and the meaningful interactions, in the community.	</p>
