<figcaption> An avid writer who would pen Chinese poems to relieve her stress, Chionh Wan Qi (21A01) deepened her learning of the Chinese language through JPJC’s Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP). The programme has also allowed her to deepen her love for Chinese language and culture, and more clearly narrow down her career options related to this field.</figcaption></figure>

<center><h5>The CLEP valedictorian never gave up</h5></center>

<p>Growing up as a little girl, Chionh Wan Qi was surrounded by various elements of Chinese culture and language. In primary school, she was a skilful player of erhu and yangqing in the Chinese Orchestra. At home, listening to JJ Lin over the audio player and watching Chinese drama were regular pastime fixtures. It was no wonder that when asked what her most memorable experience was as a student of the Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP), Wan Qi, immediately rattled on about the song-writing workshop conducted by two industry professionals in the field. “My group did not expect to face so much difficulty with rhyming the lyrics and matching them with the melody. Visualising the storyline helped with the wordplay. I was so proud of our final product!” Indeed, the demo was shortlisted in the top 25 song-list in the prestigious ‘Xin Kong Xia《新空下》National Schools Xinyao Singing and Song-writing Competition’ – a feat that was a first for the college.</p>

<p>What would come as a surprise was that Wan Qi, an avid writer who would pen Chinese poems to de-stress, had actually started out with _poor_ grades and _not_ liking the Chinese language. It was her mother’s introduction to these various forms of Chinese media that sparked her interest in the beauty of the language. By the time little Wan Qi progressed to secondary school, she had taken her interest further, choosing to read ‘Literature in Chinse’ at the O Levels, a rarity among her generation of peers. Wishing to pursue her passion even deeper, she researched about CLEP after getting wind of the programme from her Literature tutor who had waxed lyrical about it in class. Having heard excellent reviews from the predecessors of CLEP seniors, Wan Qi was determined to make the cut, charting her path towards enrolment into Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC). Enthralled by the various opportunities that the college offered with its strong supplementary in-house CLEP curriculum that well complemented the demands of the programme’s objectives, Wan Qi took a leap of faith. She applied via Direct School Admission (DSA) for CLEP rather than Chinese Orchestra which would have been a safer bet given her years of musical experience and talent.</p>

“Taking CLEP at JPJC was the obvious choice for me. JPJC’s CLEP is much more established and offers its own internal curriculum of various enrichment programmes, beyond MOE’s offerings”, Wan Qi recounts. While some may be puzzled at the 12-pointer’s choice of institution, she was steadfast in her decision. “Each JC has its own unique strengths. While they may vary in academic standing, ultimately each of us are on the same path – learning the very same curriculum and undergoing the same examinations. It is up to the individual student to make the best of the experience. The fit of the institution to your strengths and personality is more important.”</p>

<p>Indeed, it was at JPJC that Wan Qi truly flourished. In her words, “While taking Chinese Literature at the O levels taught me to appreciate the language, I stopped short at exploring the subject beyond the demands of the examination. At JPJC, the internal CLEP curriculum truly exposed me to a wide range of contexts in which Chinese exists so pertinently in our everyday life. The culture came alive before my very eyes.” As a Chinese Language Elective Scholarship award holder, Wan Qi had the privilege to attend the MOE Immersion Programme. While the pandemic had reformatted the overseas trip to a 3-day online camp, the rich insights she had gleaned were certainly not curtailed. “Aspects of the culture and rich traditions were intertwined deeply with specific regions of China. It was a refreshing outlook as they manifested so differently from our local Chinese culture that I was so accustomed to.” Wan Qi quips as she reflects on her experience, bright-eyed as she recalls the various interactions she had with the local students there, which enabled her to appreciate the similarities and contrasts with the Singapore perspective. She has a particular knack for drawing parallels and divergences, and it is with this analytical mind that Wan Qi pondered further over the play featured in her textbook 《傻姑娘与怪老树》(loosely translated ‘the silly lady and the strange old tree’). A seminar with illustrious playwright Kuo Jian Hong (daughter of Kuo Pao Kun who wrote the play) who shared snippets of her father’s life and inspiration of the play, as well as after-play conversations with the actors, gave Wan Qi a powerful revelation. “While the power of the language lies in its ability to reflect social ills; it is the beauty of the language that taps on one’s heartstrings to care and remedy these ills.” Satiating her thirst for her passion, Wan Qi further immersed herself in various experiences, participating actively across numerous workshops such as ‘Tea Appreciation’, ‘Three-line Poems’ and ‘Flash Fiction’.</p>

<p>Beyond intellectual pursuits, Wan Qi led a full and holistic college life, developing other competencies such as in leadership. She was a student councillor who also served as a House Captain; and oversaw the organisation of various student-led activities such as the House-Initiated Events and Matriculation & Orientation.</p>

<p>Looking back on her pre-university education, the Valedictorian of the CLEP programme admits that JC life was not always a bed of roses, so much so that the student councillor had actually considered dropping out to switch to the Polytechnic route even though she was already in her second year of study at the time. “JC life was stressful both in the academic and non-academic fronts. It was difficult to juggle the various responsibilities all at the same time. Furthermore, I struggled with Economics. l just could not pass my tests despite studying hard for them.” Upon further research, changing track further presented itself to be a feasible option. Wan Qi need not give up on her love for Chinese as there was a suitable course available. Furthermore, her CLEP and CLL background would give her an added advantage to skip reading a year’s worth of modules. The investment of her time in the JC system was not a sunk cost after all. Enticed, Wan Qi took further action and told her Civics Tutor (CT) of her intentions. “My CT helped me to put things into perspective and guided me through the process of weighing the pros and cons of both options. She also shared anecdotes of poly life as seen through the lens of her son. The conversation helped me to appraise the situation better. I came to realise that the stress I felt was actually to be expected. After all, JC life at a much faster pace yet coupled with greater complexity and of a heavier load.” Recalling that fateful conversation, Wan Qi felt thankful towards her CT, “My CT never pressured me into either choice. By nature of being a DSA student, I was obligated to fulfil the 2-year completion of my JC education. Nonetheless, she was more concerned that I make an informed decision and assured me to do what’s best for my circumstances. It was very comforting to have a CT that truly cared for me.”</p>

<p>Upon further deliberation, Wan Qi decided to stay on. The projects and deadlines that were weighing down on her had already come to pass. CCA was also standing down with the JC1 juniors taking over. More importantly, her battle with Economics had taken a positive turn. “Market Structure was a difficult topic. I spent my holidays understanding the concept; making reference to my notes. I kept on revising; and I finally got it!”, exclaimed Wan Qi as she recalled the Eureka moment and which had in turn manifested as good results. This further affirmed her on her decision to continue; and she felt renewed to stay the course. “Even though JC is tough, it is not unbeatable. I became more confident that I would be able to cope.”</p>

<p>The conducive environment and support found at college also played a large part. Wan Qi and her friends – even those from other classes – banded together to form a study group, creating a conducive enclave for themselves. “The regular revisions sessions motivated everyone especially when we were feeling sluggish and procrastinating. When one of us took out his or her notes, the rest would soon follow suit. In trying times, we all came to be pillars of support for one another. The camaraderie was uplifting; and we felt that we had each other to see through our journey together.” Wan Qi also credits her teachers for delivering interesting lessons and extending that culture of care beyond the classroom. “They would give timely reminders and sit patiently with me through consultation sessions outside of curriculum time. There was once when I had to be rushed to hospital due to a gastric episode. It was really nice of them to check in on me and even ask after my health regularly.”</p>

<p>When asked about her ambitions for the future, Wan Qi readily answered without missing a beat. The college’s CLEP programme had provided opportunities for students to work with various organisations to enable them to better understand career paths related to the Chinese language; this had helped narrowed her choices. Still reeling from a sense of accomplishment she had felt having had her article published in Lianhe Zaobao under its ‘cub journalist’ programme, she responded, “I would like to apply for the Chinese Government Scholarship offered to CLEP students to be enrolled into Fudan or Peking University to study social sciences to understand the underpinnings of society – how it works and how good relations are built. More specifically, I am looking for a career in the Chinese media industry in Singapore after my education.” Her heartfelt motivations soon followed. “With a more global outlook and a career in this field, I hope to better influence Singaporeans of the Chinese culture. Ultimately, I want to be its advocate. Our heritage is a hidden treasure, it remains steadfast even as the world progresses. It is after all our root – reflecting snippets of society – it is about you and me.”	</p></div>
